Hey listeners, Harika here, and I am super excited to welcome you to Uptalk.
If you are ready to learn and get your hands worked wonders in the world of information
technology, then you are in a right place.
When I say Uptalk, we are not just another headache company, consider we are your learning
partner committed to unlocking your full potential, whether you are stopping into the world
of technology for the first time or looking to advance your career, we provide top 10 hands
on courses to build up your career.
Let's take our first step towards learning here and explore it.
Now I am just going to talk a little bit technical.
That is what we call this RPA architecture.
That is Uipata architecture.
Uipata architecture.
When I say Uipath architecture means you should understand what are the tools we are going
to use it.
If I ask you to store the data in Excel means what application you needed adjust.
I am asking you a question.
I want you to put the data in the form of intersection of rows and columns, which application
use it.
I am asking you the question, I have a data like this, put a data in the intersection of
rows and columns and generate a pivot chart.
Which tool you will ask me Excel?
You should you to work with Uipath.
I am asking you to design a process mean you should know which tool to use it.
Yes correct.
That is why I am going to teach you about Uipath architecture.
How we do?
What are the components?
We can say components of Uipath.
When I talk about just to make you understand, just giving you normal layman definitions,
one layer I am not going to talk to you.
More technical also.
One is orchestrator.
One is Uipath assistant.
And one is Uipath studio studio, studio X.
Anything anything, you can use Uipath studio or you can use Uipath studio.
But these are the three main components and one.
Now when you talk about these three components, well I can see this three component, Manchela.
What I want to tell you in a common example, it works in the form of it works generally
the architecture, the architecture of Uipath.
Works in the form of works in the client server technology mode.
What do you mean with client and what is server?
I think you know, I think a little bit more technical.
You know what is the client and what is the server?
Server data.
We already put the data and that is basically stored.
Why you are putting in the server?
Why can't you keep it in your own machine?
What is the reason you are keeping the data?
Basically this is one of the reason is that the data is stored and I mean there is analyze
and all server is done and then safety also and security point of also.
Maybe there is the safety security.
Very important one point why you are keeping in server.
All the data, your data from the all machine is collected there.
What is the reason why you are keeping in server?
Why can't you keep it in your own laptop?
That is my question.
Laptop means a server also.
Have a big database means memory also and in my laptop may be the limited memory.
One simple question I will ask you.
You have some finance data.
You didn't keep it in server.
You've gone for some vacation.
Now some emergency purpose finance data is required by your manager.
I understood.
What will happen?
Please come and don't take leave.
Come back.
We want some finance data.
That can I say it is nothing but server is a central location.
Central location.
Correct.
Understood.
Got it.
Everything.
You want to keep it in a server base.
Not only for security and this one.
You want to keep it where the every user can access it.
Can access it.
Correct.
Yes or no?
That is what we call this like that in your path.
I'm making you to understand I automation anyway.
Your path works in the form of client server technology.
When I let me take a pic.
I hope you can see my screen.
Yes.
Sure.
If you want, you can take a screenshot of this also.
But I'll tell you when to take a screenshot.
I'm just making into two layer.
One is client and one is server.
I'm just putting a line here.
This is my what we'll do.
This is the server.
And this is my client.
Yes or no?
When I'm talking about client, client is nothing but our laptop.
Oh no.
The client, every user of the client.
This is a laptop.
This is a manual and laptop.
This is like x person, y person, z person.
All these people are being there.
Oh no.
Each one laptop.
Now this is the client where the client we connect.
So in your path, we won't call the word call server.
We call the word call orchestrator.
What we call this and when you control it, it is like a control all the time.
All the clients will connect to the server connect to server.
This all this user or connect to this server understood.
We won't use a word called orchestrator.
What we call this?
What is the word we are using in UI path?
Orchestrator.
Orchestrator.
And I want to tell you, it is a web-based application.
It is a web-based application.
It is a web-based.
Can you see?
There is an orchestrator.
I'm using ipad cloud.
I'm using it.
AI path given me a slot for me.
That is what we call this tenant.
I got a rent.
I got a rent from you know, cloud is a huge memory space.
You may be heard about Amazon workspace Azure.
These are the different cloud architecture.
We have it.
Now they gave me your path, given me a tenant name call.
When I go and click on here, you can see that where I'm moving it.
I'm moving to my own orchestrator.
Can you see?
Can you see the term orchestrator?
Can you see some data here?
Can you see some?
When I go on click on tenant, you can see a lot of information.
Can you see?
Like some, you can see something.
Something I created.
When I go to my training, you can see one process I created.
One trigger, I have one user, I have one mission, some data I created.
I just what type of application it is.
It's a window-based application, or it is a web-based application.
It is web-based, I think.
It's a web-based.
But manjoa, you did something, no.
But I can see one process, one trigger, one user, something.
You have some data.
But where is this data substitute?
Whatever I did, no one process I created, one trigger I created, one user I created.
You know Ajay, this is just the user interface.
Oh no.
User interface means what?
Just we'll click on it.
But where this data is stored, you take a SAP application itself.
You enter some data.
So where did it stored?
What server?
Which server?
Client server we say.
Whatever you entered in the SAP application, where it is going stored, SAP is a web-based application.
Where it is stored, whatever data invoice detail accounts, detail, something you entered, no.
Where the details are stored?
We know it is stored, I don't know.
Correct.
But it is, we call them as database support.
It is called, what is called data server?
No, this is different.
We call them as esculer server.
You heard about or not.
Esculer server.
The esculer server is connected with you.
This is my front end application and this is my back end application.
This is front end.
Front end means what?
Just we will enter the data.
But where it is stored?
It is stored in your database.
From client and orchestrator is the front end.
In the server side itself, orchestrator is one server.
In the orchestrator we have two component edges.
In the orchestrator we have two components.
One is orchestrator, one is esculer server, as a cuver.
But why I need this component?
Because this orchestrator is what type of application?
What type of application I do?
Base.
Web base is nothing but user interface, user interface.
Whatever, I am doing it here where it is stored in server.
Circular server.
In the server itself, we have two components.
What are the two components?
One is orchestrator, one is esculer server, as a cuver.
Now see they won't directly give an access.
Did they?
Will they see the user who creating a bot can directly go and store it in esculer server?
In this interface only they can do it, orchestrator, orchestrator only.
Now what we can do with orchestrator but I am telling you, add it, you won't do it.
I am talking about RPA developer, RPA citizen developer.
They won't give an access to this machine.
This will be taken care by a technical people.
I take guys technical sure, cool this one.
Server server.
Who are highly rich technical guys?
Can you take care of it?
Now in all your machine what they will install it?
They will install only UI path.
Let me go back.
Where is my diagram?
Look up.
What are the components we talk about?
Orchestrator.
And one more thing, one more component.
I told you.
What are the things?
Server SQL Server.
Sorry, these are the, let me take.
On the server side we have two component.
What are the two component?
SQL Server and orchestrator.
I'll just connect like this.
Let me put it like this.
SQL Server is connected.
SQL Server is connected to orchestrator.
Now this is the two component on the server side.
When you talk about the client side, which tool they will install.
In the client side, it's nothing but user.
Which are the user?
Who are the user?
When you talk about user, they are different type of user.
Appier developer.
Appier citizen developer.
Attended bot.
Runner attended.
Attended.
On attended.
And then one is called production.
These are license based.
Adject.
These are the client.
Now I want ages to create a bot using studio.
What license I will give it to you?
I want Adject client client citizen developer.
No, I want to be an Appier developer.
Developer developer technical.
Technical.
That means I will give you this license.
Technical developers.
I want ages because ages is from finance background.
He is not technical background.
He want to use.
I'll just put you technical developer.
What license it is called?
Studio.
But for Appier citizen developer.
Studio.
No, Adject.
Let me take.
These are the two user who created a lot of process.
Adject.
You imagine you created 20.
Which department you are working on.
Your finance department.
Adject.
These are the 10 process I want to automate.
They're giving to you.
You created the process.
Technically, you created using studio or studio x.
Forget about that.
Now we're all the process of storage.
Orchestrators.
Orchestrators.
Now I'll take you.
This is my studio.
Adject.
This is my studio.
Can you see Ipa's studio community?
Now can you see some of the process I created here?
Let me take you through this thing.
Age it.
Super.
It is studio.
It is studio is what type?
I think my laptop.
What type of application should age it?
First, you understand it is a window application or it is a web based application.
It is window.
It's a window note.
Whatever you do in window application, where it is stored.
In my local drive, can I tell you where it is?
Now I'm asking you a question.
You created process for your team department.
Now you want to run the process.
You each user see you created 20 process for different your department.
Do you think that if they will come to your laptop and run the process, every process?
No, that is not possible.
Then your work will be disturbed.
Yes sir.
Everybody cannot come and touch your home.
Age it move, I want to run my process.
Some people, I want to run the process.
Completely entire will go for that one.
You cannot do your work.
Or your process.
Whatever you create, it will be in your local mission.
Now you want to run it on other mission.
Let me go back to my diagram.
Now who is?
This is your mission.
Now you created a process.
This is your laptop.
Now now this is.
Let me put your name.
Then you will understand this is mission.
And this is...
Now Manjula want to run the bot which is created by age it.
What do you do?
You will transfer the file here.
Logically I will transfer.
Now logically you should not do this.
I would say what I were doing, we are transferring the file.
And then, but this is a process.
This is application.
You cannot run it in.
You cannot copy this that UI path folder to this Manjula's folder.
Will they allow pin driving your mission?
No, they don't allow.
How can you transfer the file from age mission to Manjula's mission?
We will save some web application.
You will put it somewhere in the shared drive and sharing the shared.
Which is our shared drive here.
Imagine tell you which is my shared drive.
That is nothing which is a server here.
So tell me that word which is a server here.
Orchestrator and SQL Server.
Now now forget about SQL Server is a database.
You have a face about orchestrator.
What you will do?
You will upload the bot when you go to your IPath.
See when I take this process.
Imagine this is transaction process.
I created a chip.
Now this process.
You can see there is a button called publish.
Can you see?
There is the open this button.
You know where it will go.
That it will move with the orchestra.
Can you see?
There is an orchestrator and personal workspace.
Oh no.
Orchestrator for tenant workspace.
Automatically it will go to where?
Click on next.
And if you click publish button, you know what will happen.
It will go on. Push it there.
Where it will go?
It will go to my orchestrator.
Where is my orchestrator?
It will go here.
Can you see?
There is a word called automation.
Automation.
When I go who I am, I am a tenant.
Ten.
You can see there is a package.
Can you see all the process here?
Automatically comes here.
You got it.
It is come as what?
Package.
Now if I want now what happened?
Let me go back again diagram.
Once you create a process, you are uploading here.
It will come to the orchestrator.
Once you come where it is stored now.
It is stored as a packet.
I will put it.
It is stored as a package.
Now you want to run the bot in which machine?
Who want to run the bot?
Man.
Manjula want to run the bot means I cannot directly run the bot in the manjula mission.
In manjula mission also, I need UI path.
Correct?
No.
Because computer cannot understand.
I need manjula also.
What type of manjula user is?
A cheat.
I will give you as a license.
What license I will give you to you is RPA developer.
RPA developer.
Developer license.
I will give it to you.
Got it.
A cheat.
You are a developer.
You are going to create a bot.
RPA developer or RPA citizen developer.
RPA citizen developer.
But manjula manjula is she is not from technical background.
She don't know how to create a bot.
She is not interested in development.
But she want to run the process.
Got your point.
Now what license I will give it to Manjula?
RPA citizen developer.
She don't want to create a bot at all.
She don't want to create a process.
She doesn't know about UI path.
She will only view you would say.
She will only run it.
Run it.
Only run the process.
Attend and attend use.
Yes exactly.
Let me go back to my notepad.
I will give Manjula as attended or unattended.
But when I will give attended.
When I will give unattended.
Tell me.
I think from the word itself clear as it.
You try to tell me.
Then you will.
When I say means I told this answer.
Manjula corrected me this answer.
Tell me what you mean by attended.
What do you mean by unattended?
Who can work on it?
That means there is some user input is required for you.
You are going to run the bot.
Manjula want to run the bot.
Then I will give her a license.
What license?
Attend it.
I cannot go and run whatever.
I want to run in my own time.
See, I want to run when I come to the office.
I want to run at evening time.
That's it.
Evening time is based on my mood understood, understood.
I am not fixing any time.
Whenever I need, I want to run the bot means.
Manjula will give what license.
Attend it license.
But I want to run the bot every day
without the presence of Manjula at 9 o'clock.
Or every Monday morning I want to execute it.
Or every monthly I want to execute it.
Or every day 12 o'clock I want to execute it.
Without Manjula's presence.
Please underline the word.
Without Manjula's presence attended.
It's a presence here.
Which license I will give it to Manjula.
It is unattended.
That's it.
If Manjula, if you want to run the bot,
if you want to run the process
with the presence of presence of humans,
then I need what life of license I will give it to.
Attend it attended.
You can run the process without human intervention
at specific time schedule.
Time schedule.
I think you know about,
maybe whether you know about scheduling the event.
Scheduling background job.
I think we call them a trigger.
Trigger.
Trigger means at specific time.
In SAP we already scheduled the background job.
That's work.
Work type of license I will give it to Manjula.
Unended.
Say I want to run the bot every day 12 o'clock in the night.
But I cannot come to office at 12 o'clock
and go open my laptop.
Open UI Math Assistant and I'll run it edge it.
See when I you know that how Manjula,
how I will run my bot manually means see,
I don't have an Orchistrator control.
Can you see there is one?
Can you see one icon edge it?
I can see when you open it you can.
Can you see the library process?
I can go and run it.
This is called attended automation.
What we call this?
Attended automation.
Why attended automation?
Because it is run by someone.
Exactly.
I am opening my UI path assistant and I am selecting.
You can see the list of bot automatically.
You can see a list of process.
All the process you can select and you can run it.
Got it.
This is what we call the satellite license.
But I want to show you automatically.
See when I go to my Orchistrator you can.
When I go to my training you can see an automation.
Automation.
Can you see trigger?
I can select it.
Add a new trigger.
Now can you see what option I did?
Disimple.
Disimple.
If I go and say enable means it automatically run it.
You can see that if I want I'll show you add new triggers.
Can you see that?
What is the process?
All the inputs I need to give.
Which process I want to execute it?
What time I want to execute it?
Whether you want run every five minutes,
one every two hours, one every day, every weekly, every monthly.
Like just various options you can see.
Which type of automation it is.
On it ended.
That's it.
One time should leave.
I missed it.
That is what we call this.
When I come to the Orchistrator or diagram you understood.
Now Manjula again, she will connect it.
Now what type of license she will create it.
She will get either attended or unattended.
Unattended but remember Manjula.
Now I'm asking the question again what type of application it is.
This is your window based.
Window based.
This is window based.
You may be thinking in logical.
Imagine how window is connecting to my web based.
Did you have the thought with you?
How this is connecting?
Manjula, when you go and click on publish,
how it is connecting to server?
How it is connecting to server Manjula?
See when I go and click on publish.
I understood when I go and click next, next, next and I click publish button.
You know it is, can you see this compiling activity?
It is building.
Can you see what message I'm getting?
What type of publish it is?
It is published now.
Where it is published?
Where it is gone?
Where this process gone?
It is gone to where?
Where we are.
Where we are?
It is gone here.
Ajit.
When you go and come, where is my where I can see tenant?
Ten in the package.
What is the file I updated?
Transaction.
Let me see whether let's see based on the published.
See these are the published I published by two years,
but two, three years a year ago.
Let's see whether today is some five months ago, a year ago.
That's it where it is published.
Go to my workspace.
Can you see a transaction?
This is the transaction.
Why it is published here?
Ajit.
Because how it is connected?
When I go and click on publish, how it comes to my orchestrator?
Through web, I think web technology.
Know through this, I path assistant.
Yeah, path assistant.
When I go on, can you see what color I'm getting?
It dream.
When I go and click on this thing, preference, click on preference or orchestrator setting.
Can you tell me what is this man?
This is your path.
This is the orchestrator where you can see.
You all are.
This is my you all.
What I'm saying is when I go back to my diagram,
when I go back to my diagram, where is my diagram here?
I path studio.
Your laptop is not connected through your thing.
In each and every machine, what is the other thing is installed?
Or I path studio is installed and the path assistant is installed.
I path studio.
I path assistant.
This path assistant is a small software.
It's a small window application.
It's a small service.
Your laptop is not connected.
Your ipad assistant is connected.
You are path through ipad assistant.
Only you are connecting it.
Between ipad studio and orchestrator, who is in between?
As a ipad assistant, we call them as an agent.
I think what you are.
I think I find that you are using the frequently using the word called robot.
Robot.
It is when your path comes in the beginning they use a word called eipath robot only.
Now only they change the word called eipath assistant.
You are path assistant.
In that eipath assistant, we have a two component agent in your path.
Where is my not path?
In your ipad assistant, where is it?
In your path assistant, we have a two component.
What is called eipath agent and the ipad executor?
Agent and robot is same.
Executor and robot is the same.
Agent, you know what is the work of agent?
Agent what he will do?
He will be an intermediate.
He will be between orchestrator and studio or the studio.
When I am publishing it, you know when I am publishing it here.
Agent will work.
Now I told you know agent, I want to run the bot in manjolars machine.
Where the bot is here?
Orchestrator package.
Orchestrator, you know what will happen.
When it is running the bot on manjolars machine,
from here I can tell you one more word called process.
What is that word called?
Up.
Sheet, I want to tell you we can.
When I explain you, you will understand.
We cannot directly execute the package.
We cannot directly execute the package.
What we will do?
We will convert the package into process.
We will convert package into process.
Now when I running the process in manjolars machine,
you know what will happen.
When it when I am running here on manjolars machine,
it download the package agent.
Download all the packages.
Once it is downloaded,
who will you, which one will link you bypass,
which component will you use?
That is my notepad.
When I am downloading the package,
which tool will you help me?
Then we execute agent we use.
In this case, I will execute.
Agent we use.
Agent agent agent.
When I am uploading,
when I upload or download from
more orchestrator to e-path,
e-path client,
we will tell e-path client.
Or we can call them as e-path client.
That time, who will you help us?
But when I execute,
when I execute the bot,
who will work?
Because you know whatever we are creating,
which is in high level language.
Yes my agent?
Do you think that your computer
will understand high level language?
Now we need a translator.
No translated.
Yes, for that we need LiPath executor.
Understand, this is an architecture.
We talk about the component.
What are the four, five components we have?
A School of Server,
Ipath assistant and Ipath studio host your ex.
In the client side,
we are called them as a user,
but we need studio and studio ex.
But for this we need what like.
What is the thing we need?
Manjai, one thing I want to tell you,
that means,
do I need to install e-path assistant separately?
When you are installing,
when you are downloading studio know,
assistant already downloaded.
This is what this is the architecture of your Ipath.
