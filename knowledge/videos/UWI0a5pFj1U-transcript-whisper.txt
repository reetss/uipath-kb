You are absolutely new to UI path.
And as a developer, you need to understand what should be your roadmap.
How do you start your learning?
From where do you start your learning?
And what are the topics that you should cover one after the other?
I'm going to show you the entire roadmap for the UI path developer.
For this, come to academy.uipath.com.
Once you are on this page, click on learning plans.
And once you are on the learning plan, scroll down and select your preferred language.
So here I'm going to select English.
Once you've selected the preferred language, the next is roles.
So if you expand this particular section, there are many roles that you can plan for.
So this particular video is specifically for the developers.
For the developers, you would be selecting this particular option, automation developer.
So once you have selected automation developer as the role, you would see there are a couple of plans available here.
Automation explorer, automation developer, automation developer, professional.
Automation developer associate training, automation explorer, so there are many things.
Now out of this, what you do, select the professional training.
In the future, the version might change.
Right now, while I'm recording this video, it is 2023.10.
The version might change.
Doesn't matter.
Look for the professional training.
I'm going to click on this professional training.
So out of all this, this one is the professional training.
I'm going to click on this.
Now once you click on this, there is something called learning plan structure.
Click on learning plan structure.
Now all I'm doing, I'm going to minimize everything.
If you minimize, there are three important areas that you have to study.
The very first one is automation explorer.
The version in the future might change.
Automation explorer, your first thing to start with.
Then comes automation developer associate training.
This is your second thing.
And the third thing is the automation developer professional training.
The first one, the R that is mentioned here is 10 R 30 minutes.
This might slightly change up and down based on the version.
However, this is where you would start.
Next is 32 hours.
And the third one, the professional training, is around 40 hours.
Now in the automation explorer, expand this.
And check out all the courses one by one.
The first one is a pre-training survey.
And the second one is explore automation development with UI path.
Now for this, you first log in.
You need to sign in to academy.uapa.com,
so that all the progress that you are making will be tracked.
So signing in is important part.
Now you start with the each one by one.
So you would start with explore automation development with UI path.
Then you would get into build your first automation process with studio.
Variables constant arguments in studio.
Control flow in studio.
Excel automation with modern experience in studio.
User interface UI automation with modern design.
So all of this courses, once you have completed,
that means you have completed the automation explorer course,
which is of around 10 hours, 30 minutes.
Now as a beginner, you can take help of many YouTube channels there.
One is my channel.
So in this, for example, you would like to start as a beginner.
So my first recommendation is to go to my homepage.
Or search for this particular video.
UI path tutorial for beginners.
This one I have made for 2024 edition.
However, most of the concepts and things would remain the same.
Here and there, there could be slight changes in the user interface of the studio
because of the version.
Otherwise, most of your concepts would remain the same.
Once you are done with this, go to the playlist channel.
In the playlist, if you scroll to the bottom of the playlist,
it will take some time to load.
Now, there are many, many, many playlist that I have created.
UI path tutorial for beginners, build data table, mobile activity, email automation.
UI path, RIFM, UI path, Excel automation, regular expressions,
orchestrate a storage bucket.
There are many videos, actually.
So what do you do?
Go through the courses.
For example, you got doubt around variable constant arguments studio.
So you can search for videos.
For example, you can search UI path variables and arguments, for example.
So there will be ample of videos present.
Here, you would see.
So I also have one video.
You have a tutorial example of variables in UI path automated with Rakesh.
So you can take benefit of many such videos available on YouTube to clarify your doubts
and get some practical examples in case the topics that is explained here,
you need additional help, you can take.
So like that, you first complete the automation explorer.
And once you are done.
So there is something, automation explorer assessment completed.
So once you have completed the assessment and scored, good score.
That means you are now good knowledge on the very first area.
Second thing what you do, get onto automation developer associate training.
Now, this would have little advanced topics.
For example, data manipulation with strings in studio, data manipulation with list and dictionaries,
UI automation synchronization.
So for all of these topics, you can search on YouTube and find a lot of videos
and directly come to my channel, search there.
So for example, if you are on my channel, you want to search a particular topic.
For example, I want to search for let's say data manipulation with strings.
So you can come here, go to the video, use this search option.
So the topic is data manipulation with strings.
So I'll simply say, for example, strings search.
So here, you can see you have a tutorial string manipulation with the VV.NET playlist.
I have an entire playlist with a lot of practical examples, a lot of videos you can directly see, watch and clarify your doubts.
This is one thing.
If you still have doubts, there is something called forum.uapad.com.
So there are already like you, many people might have already called doubts
and they might have already asked questions.
You can search here in the forum and look for the answers.
If it is not there, you can always post a question and get answer from the community.
So these are the couple of things.
Similar way, once you have gone through all of this, look at the topics.
UI Automation Descriptor in Studio, Selectors in Studio, Debugging in Studio.
For example, Debugging in Studio, I'll show you.
Debugging. So I'll use this.
Type Debugging.
And here you can see UI path remote debugging.
This is not the one.
Debugging steps, UI path debugging steps.
So there will be certain videos you would definitely find on the channel to get help from.
So likewise, you complete all the courses, PDF automation, email automation.
For all of this, also, I have a lot of videos.
For example, PDF automation.
I think there's a playlist I have created long back.
Let me show you.
You can document understanding action center scroll down.
Excel or say, here it is.
UI per tutorial on PDF automations.
Excel automations like that.
Slightly, as I said, this was created long back.
So the version, the couple of things might slightly change.
But again, your overall concepts would remain to my knowledge.
Most of the things would remain conceptually same.
Bit of features, properties, how it works.
Activities might slightly change.
But it will help you to understand how it works.
Then you can easily explore.
So likewise, you go object repository in Studio, version control, workflow analyzer,
RPA testing with Studio.
So for all of this topics, I have playlist created.
Just search and see for the playlist.
In case you don't find it, there are also other channels on YouTube where you can also take help from.
Now, once you have completed this, finally, there is an assessment.
Now, never forget to give the assessment.
Always give the assessment.
Once you give the assessment, you truly know how many things that you know,
how many things you missed out.
So you can always go back, refer, correct yourself, learn that thing.
Again, you can give the assessment in number of times.
So you have given the assessment.
And the final one is the automation developer professional training.
Now, this is what, if you are looking for a job, completing these three things are important.
What are the three things?
The automation explorer, automation developer associate training,
and the professional training is also absolutely required.
Because most of your job questions will be from you, from the professional training.
For example, RIFM work concepts.
How would you design a dispatcher board?
How do you design a Baltimore board?
So all of these are mentioned here.
Introduction to RIFM work, building RIFM work project, building RIFM project with tabular data,
practice with RIFM work, orchestrated triggers and monitoring.
So most of the professional work that we do is you would learn from this.
Those are foundations that is definitely needed.
Now, these are the actual professional work that you will be doing.
You will be developing projects.
So going through this state machine, RIFM are very important ones.
Very, very important.
All of these that is here are very, very important.
AI, computer vision, remote debugging, invoke method.
For all of this, you would see courses playlist in my channel.
Code automation for testing.
Build automation with sedition accelerator.
Automation developer professional training.
So try to see and take help from all the available resources that I have shown you.
First is your academy.
You have YouTube.
You have forum and a lot many other sources on the Internet
to learn from.
So this is what the complete guide that you have to follow as a road map
to complete your learning as a developer.
So once you have done this, what is next?
Once you have done, what is next, you should appear for the certification.
For example, if I go to certification,
so here you have something called UAPAT certified professional automation developer associate.
So here also if you look at automation developer learning plan,
if I click on the learning plan, it will show you those two important ones.
One is automation explorer developer associate training.
So once you have completed these two trainings,
you can also plan to appear for this exam.
Similar way, once you have completed all the three,
for example, if I click on this learning plan,
learning plan structure, if I minimize everything,
you see the same two are there and the third one is professional training.
Now for this, go to certification and you can also schedule your certification for this one.
UAPAT certified professional automation developer professional.
This is the certification name.
And this is how your exam description document is there.
Free online practice test is there.
Schedule your exam.
All these buttons are there.
You just have to go and follow the instructions to schedule your exam.
Give your exam.
Now for example, you're planning for certifications.
You would find on my channel,
I have created a certification playlist as well.
Let me show you.
So associate associate exam,
there is a certification,
13 videos that I've created.
Not completed this playlist, but again, yeah,
you have few videos there.
But for professional one,
you can see I have 99 videos this one.
Okay, so new exam UAPAT certified professional automation.
So this is what you can complete and you can appear.
This is a additional help to clarify your conceptual things.
It will help you this video.
99 videos I have created that you can take help from.
Okay, so let's say you have done all of this.
What is next as a developer?
Okay, as a next thing as a developer is nothing but this one.
UAPAT certified professional specialized AI associate.
And then UAPAT certified professional specialized AI professional.
So these are the next thing.
Once you got certified as a professional,
then the AI part comes into picture for sure in 2025.
Now for this,
if you want to go with the learning plan,
you can directly also click here.
Specialized AI associate training and click on the learning plan structure.
You would get to see see automation developer.
Then you have the same similar topics introduction to AI powered automation.
Explore automation development with UI path,
build your first automation position studio.
So many things you must have already covered.
So this would be a cakewalk for you.
Simply you can go through data manipulation and all this.
Okay, the important part is starts from here.
Introduction to specialized AI,
UI path AI center,
UI part document understanding,
UI path communication mining.
So these are the courses that you have to complete one by one.
So if you click on any of these course,
it will take you the course and you can start.
Okay, so this is the next planning associate training.
After that, specialized AI associate this one.
And then the next one is.
Okay, this is done.
You can schedule your exam.
Okay, this is the same same structure you follow.
Next thing is specialized AI professional.
So here again,
if you click on this.
Click on learning plan structure.
And it would have the similar structure,
UI path AI center specialized AI document understanding,
specialized AI training,
UI path communication mining,
UI path AI center.
So like this,
you have additional professional areas on with respect to AI.
So when you complete this entire course,
then you can go ahead and apply for the certification.
When you are confident,
you can go ahead and apply for the certification.
Okay, schedule your exam and give the certification.
So this is the next thing next level thing.
Okay, after that,
let's say I have got specialized AI professional certification.
Then you are also planning you have got good experience.
And then as a developer,
now you want to look for a solution architect role.
You would like to improve.
Then as a solution architect again,
there is a plan here.
Okay, automation solution architect learning plan.
So as a developer,
once you have had some experience,
then you can become architect.
You can't become architect as a beginner.
As a beginner, you can't.
You have to spend some time as a developer,
gain some more work experience.
Then you can look for a next promotion or next role is
a solution architect role.
Okay, so automation solution architect role.
Again,
if you click on the learning plan structure,
you have everything here.
Introduction implementation methodology deep dive,
meet the components of your platform.
So as a solution architect,
you have knowledge on all these various areas.
Because this is all needed as a solution architect.
Okay, so these are the topics for you.
Getting it.
So let's say,
you know,
solution architect is considered as the
one of the highest role in the development part.
Okay,
so AI professional solution architect professional.
So your question could be,
okay, I don't do.
I need to go through AI.
I would say with 2025 and the AI progress
are being happening around the world.
Definitely AI.
Learning plan is a must,
I would say.
With the current.
Development that are happening in the market.
So having the AI knowledge,
I would say,
would become a must.
As the progress is are happening in 2025.
Okay, so I would say go for it,
solution architect professional.
And then there are other areas,
right?
People who are coming from a testing background.
So test automation,
engineer professional.
There is a learning plan.
Okay,
people who are coming from infrared background.
That is again,
there is a learning plan for them.
Okay, like,
like there are many other aspects.
But as a developer,
these are the important areas.
One is you prepare the associate planning,
as I said,
from here you can start.
The very first important part for you would be
developer associate learning plan.
You complete plan for the certification.
Second,
certification is not a must.
But having the certification
would give you that boost and confidence.
When anybody taking an interview
and you say,
I already acquired this certificate,
this certificate.
So definitely it tells to the interview.
This person knows about the platform quite well.
And he's certified.
Right?
So you gain that confidence.
So having is a,
you know, I would say it is good to have.
I would say,
I would recommend you to have the certifications.
Okay?
Not just learning,
but prove yourself that you really have the knowledge
and you have certified.
So developer associate is the first one.
Developer professional is your second step.
Your third step is
specialized AI associate.
Your fourth step is AI professional.
And once you have experienced few years of experience,
then go with solution architect.
So that could be your futuristic plan.
So that's all as a developer.
This should be your roadmap.
And this is how you should start learning.
