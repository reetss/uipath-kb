So once, you know, we have done the discovery phase, we have done the solution design and
we have started development also, we have started the development of the scripts also.
Now, clients, you know, they started asking me, they started asking me, they started
asking us, what is the infrastructure I need, what is the infrastructure I need to set
up the RPA, you know, infrastructure.
So, what kind of infrastructure we need, what is the infrastructure process I need to
select, how to install the boards, where to install the boards, how do I add up and integrate
the process with the security requirements of the client, how do I add up and integrate
the process with the technology requirements of the client, you know, this will be especially
today's session is little bit tricky and difficult session.
I need, you should have minimum understanding on the RPA process and tools, those people
only eligible.
If it is, if it is your first class, if you are not attended in a tool, then definitely
it will be confusing to you.
So, when we go to this stage, we got the project, RPA project, we have done some POCs, we selected
the use cases, we have done the tools comparison, we have installed the tools, we have had multiple
RPA developers, they are working on multiple POCs, now, next client question is, how these
scripts are going to be executed in production environment, for example, I have developed
one script in my laptop, if I resent to the company, who will execute that script,
how you script, somewhere you have to schedule those scripts, somewhere you have to install
those scripts, somewhere you have to deploy the scripts.
So, how many scripts we have, how many boards we have taken, so which script is running
from which board, what is the architecture, client server architecture, what kind of infrastructure
we need, what is the server operating system, what is the client operating system, so where
to install, can we install the physical server, or do we need to install any cloud environment,
so what is virtual machine, where why we are talking about virtual machine, this kind
of architecture and infra, I am going to talk about two points today, architecture, infrastructure,
architecture, infrastructure, right, so and most of the interview questions that for RPA
developer will come from today's session, so these are the questions from the client,
what is the infrastructure I need, what is the infrastructure, process I need to select,
let me tell you one live example, recently you know for one of the client we have selected
some use cases, 10 use cases, we developed some 10 scripts and we said you have a client
server architecture, so that we deploy all the scripts in client, so that you know you
can execute from the server, so some kind of discussion we had, then first of all from
the project team is you know tell me can we deploy all these scripts in local machine
or not, can we deploy these scripts in local machine or not, so do we need a server
setup, if we need server setup, do we need it, is it in VLAN or what kind of communication
process, you know in MNC to get the access for server, to host the physical server, it
is 90 days, talk time they need, so completely today I am going to talk about kind of an
administrative perspective, administrative perspective of RPA, so these are the questions
from the client, because you cannot deploy like that, you know you cannot setup a, you
cannot setup blue grisme like that or automation away, you have to follow client security guidelines,
so where to deploy, how to deploy, how many bots you have to deploy, what is the server
architecture, client architecture, you can we deploy in the laptop, Windows 7, Windows 10,
is it VM, if it is VM, how different bots will communicate, how bot to server communication,
how bot will talk to control room, so lot of things I am going to, you know discuss,
so now this is the, I can say the agenda, technology architecture principles, so just
I will go with one tool, you know high level application architecture, understanding the
production environment, so how many environments we need in RPA and environment setup, okay,
so this kind of in depth knowledge may not require but pressures, so then 17% but for
experienced people today class is most important for pressures least important, okay, so let
us begin with the first question, okay, so if you if I want to set up the client server architecture
for RPA, either for automation anyway, either for automation anyway, or for blue grisme, if you
want to set up you know client server architecture for RPA, you are an admin, let's go with this mind
mindset, your RPA admin, it is a separate skill, RPA admin, so what are the points you have to
remember before going to set up RPA infrastructure, okay, so you need to understand these principles,
if you are already from admin background, you know the session will be easy to use,
you cannot from admin background, it will be difficult, so these are the, you know some of the
points you need to remember, first principle is scalable, scalable, what do I mean by scalable,
scalable means, scalable means the RPA system must be able to grow and scale to meet the performance
goals, see, let me give you an example before going to see this definition and all, okay,
initially we hide 5 RPA developers, each developer has
blue grisme software, by using the blue grisme software, they developer the scripts,
now they have 5 scripts, which are executing 5 different processes of the client,
these 5 scripts know where we have to deploy, because already development is completed,
we have to execute the scripts, the scripts are working, somewhere you have to deploy,
so that, so these 5 scripts will execute a tiny bit layer monthly whatever it is, the scheduling,
without done, so now how many scripts we have, 5 scripts, okay, each script is deployed in one bot,
each script is deployed in one bot, so I will, I will dry a diagram, so that you will understand,
so that you will understand, say this, I have, so this is laptop 1 or computer 1,
this is computer 1, so let us go with this small example, I have two computers,
so where we have deployed, your RPA software blue grisme, so any software, it can be any two,
blue grisme, so it is executing script 1, so for me this is bot 1, so this is executing script 1,
this is executing script 2, so for me this is bot 2, for me this is bot 2,
okay, so bot 1, bot 2, no script 1 and script 2 we have, now this bot executing 20,
this bot 1, 24 by 7 is executing it and it is, it is, it has automated, you know,
daily it is running 50, 1500 tickets or applications, per day in 24 by 7, it is processing 1500
loan applications, so that process is automated, so what is the volume, bot 1 is handling per day
1500 tickets, bot 2 is also like this, it is a different process, it is a process 2,
so it has automated process 1, you know, it has automated process 2, it has automated,
it is process 1 and it is process 2 and this process 1, you know volume is 1500, this is the
different process, it is solving some 200 tickets per day, this is the current scenario,
now suddenly, you know, earlier for month only 1500 customers are applying the loan,
so I have one bot which is executing the script is enough for me, now suddenly we have,
my client is expanded the branches, they started the more branches, they got the juice volume,
so suddenly per day my client is getting 15,000 applications,
earlier how many applications were had, we are having 200, now my client is getting 15,000 applications,
we are getting 15,000 applications, but same process, the process, there is no change in the process
steps, there is no change in the process steps, no need to modify your automation script,
the same script you can run script to only sufficient, but by already my bot 1 is busy from
24 by 7, it is already executing throughout the day, it is handling 1500 applications,
already it is handling 1500 applications, now suddenly increase in the volume,
suddenly increase in the volume, so what we have to know, see, what we have to do, so question 1,
so question 1, you know question 1, can bot 1 or can bot 1 execute 15,000 applications,
can bot 1 execute 15,000 applications, no, because so it is not having time,
question 2, do we need to modify the script not required, because there is no change in the process,
so modification to script is not required, question 3, do we need additional, any additional
implementation cost, development cost, no, no additional development cost, so there is no
additional development cost, so there is no additional development cost, but what how to
solve this problem, hope you try to understand the problem first, okay, so what we have to do,
you need to take one more blow prism runtime license, in blow prism there are two type of
clients, one is interactive client, second one is runtime client, even same thing applies to
automation anyway, so you have two types of bots in any RPA technology, one type of bot is to
develop the script, see in your laptops, you installed in your current computers,
you have installed your blow prism, or automation in your UI part,
what you people are doing, you are developing it, you are testing it, you are running it,
you are executing it, but so at your level it is done, now it has to be deployed into the
server, so that server will continuously execute daily or weekly, so always RPA technology,
they comes with two types of bots, one bot you develop test and execute, other bot is only to
execute, so that the second category, first category is called interactive client, second
category is called runtime resource, runtime resource advanced is you cannot use it for development,
you cannot use it for testing, but you can only use it for only execution, but they give
you cheaper license cost, they give it with the cheaper license cost, so my point is, now
now I want to add more bots, so one bot can handle 1500 applications, but now how many applications
I have, 15000 applications, so how many additional bots we have to take, 10, 9 more,
9 more additional bots we have to take, so you have paid amount to blow prism company,
you have taken the software, so they give 9 blue prism runtime resources software, where you
install, somewhere you have to install, so you can install, so now you need to purchase 9 laptops
or computers and 9 blue prisms of waste, are you getting my point, so you need to purchase,
see now I have two laptops and two computers, now I have two computers and two blue prisms of
waste are installed, they are executing the processes, they are executing the processes,
because of the increase in the volume, because of the increase in the volume, I need additional bot,
not only additional bot, you need additional bot, somewhere you have to install that, so 9 more
computers you need and 9 more bots you need, very simple topic in my email, very simple,
so I have how many scripts I have now, two scripts, two scripts, so let us forget about this scenario,
let us forget about this scenario, so we will talk only about this scenario,
we will talk only about this scenario, so how many scripts I have, one, how many bots I have,
one, in how many systems I installed, one, very simple, that is what we are doing,
but it is not in real time, in real time my client has 10 bots, which are installing 10 computers,
which are executing one script, in all bots how many scripts I have installed, one script,
are 10 bots, 10 computers, 10 scripts, it can be, no see 10 bots, 10 computers, 10 scripts,
are one bot, 10 computers, 10 bots, so when we get the complexity,
when we get the complexity, so I have one script, which is installed in 10 bots,
each bot is installed in one computer, which 10 computers,
it increases your infrastructure cost, because you need to purchase 10 laptops or 10 computers,
each computer you have to install windows 7 or above,
each computer you have to install windows 7 or above,
so always infrastructure setup should be easy to scalable,
always what you have to remember infrastructure setup should be easy to scalable,
means instead of installing these bots in 10 different computers, you do one thing,
you have a server, one computer you call it as a server, you call it as server,
in the server you install 10 virtual machines, one computer is a server to me now,
in the server how many virtual machines I have, 10 virtual machines, we call it as a VM,
10 virtual machines, in 10 each virtual machine you deploy one bot,
so how many computers you need to purchase, one, that is going to be server,
in the server how many VMs you are about to install, 10 each VM have a one bot,
so have a VM image with you, suddenly trying to got 15 lakhs applications,
now I want to add more bots, so install one more VM at bot, install one more VM at the bot,
this is called scalability, this is called scalability, people who are not able to understand
this concept, you will not get job in 90, I am trying my developers to simplify their statements,
something is gap is there, so please try to understand, so what do you mean by scalability,
not only in RPA, if you are installing any client server architecture,
administrator of that infrastructure has to consider this point,
point is low infrastructure cost, minimum maintenance, easy to add more clients,
easy to add more clients, this is basic architecture principles, in any project not only in RPA,
so always how you set up, how you install the bots, so have a server, have a computer,
install VMs in the computer, install bots in the VM, so that no need to spend more time and money
for infrastructure, and easy to scale up, now you treat the definition,
I think I have not seen the online chart, we will see, this is done,
if I increase the capacity of the my computer, like increase the processing units,
will there be improve in the performance of the bots, see, the question is related to infrastructure,
so question is related to infrastructure, the question is, the question is,
for example, so one computer, how many VMs you installed, 10, if I can I install 1000 VMs
in one computer, it depends upon the memory, RAM or disk, it depends upon the some number of parameters,
it depends upon different parameters, so this is the question even we are facing from,
so at least whenever we ask for a VM setup, so last week I worked on the same of exactly,
so when we ask for a VM setup, their question is, tell me in which server you are installing the VM,
what is the server capacity, second question is, is this server, physical server or cloud server,
third question, if whatever it is, physical or cloud server, what is the hot disk, what is the RAM,
and what you installing that physical server, what is the VM capacity you want,
so all these points you have to keep in mind, we are going for RPA implementation,
it is not just like developing the script, all your scripts has to be installed in one or multiple
bots, your bots you have to install in one or multiple computers, so then how many see,
to answer this question, we need to go for, let us say, one server, I have installed 10 VMs,
if the server is not capable to handle more than 10 VMs, go for second server,
so like this, definitely bot performance also depends upon the VM capacity, right,
so yeah, Anku Shagarwal, hope this answers your question,
so currently if one bot is performing 1500 applications, then by increasing the resources,
will be bot able to complete, you know, CC, no, no, bot performance is, you cannot measure only on VM
capacity, bot performance is different, VM capacity is different, but bot performance also depends
upon VM capacity, it is not like, you know, if you increase the capacity of the resources,
bot performance will be improved, what has some limitation, what has some limitation,
so that will discuss slowly in coming chapters, coming, coming principles, you may some time,
so let us move on to, you know, so that is why, now if you see, now any image, any, any RPA
architecture image, this is RPA developer workstation, this is RPA developer workstation,
you know, where, where you, you develop the strips, where you test the strips,
these are called as interactive lines in groupism, the similar world is given in automation event,
here, here, you see, these are the VMs, this box indicates all the VMs are in one server,
are one computer, so that computer is installed in the VMs, each VM has a bot,
each in each VM what we installed, one bot, if you want more bots, what you want to do,
just add one more VM, if you have more bots, add one more VM, so how to configure VM,
it is admin talks, don't think too much about what is VM, how it will be configured,
that is not at all related to RPA class, you send an event to admin saying that,
I need these many VMs, should be configured on this server, each VM capacity should be like this,
okay, and each VM, no each VM should be installed with sponsors off way,
or blue prism or automation, if you are, if you are, that is why you can see clear,
this is the RPA architecture diagram, this is RPA architecture diagram, these are the interactive
lines, where you develop the scripts, so how many interactive lines we need for one project,
how many interactive lines we need for one project, depends upon the RPA developer,
strength, you have five developers in your company, have five interactive lines,
you have five blue prism developers, each developer must have a workstation, in each workstation,
interactive plan should be installed, it is a very simple question, but how many runtime
resources we have to install, it depends upon different parameters, that is what we discuss it in
you know, what is difference between interactive plan can runtime resource,
interactive plan is to develop test and execute, but runtime resource can only execute,
these are the executing processes in, you know, real time, your production environment,
bots, all these bots are installed in the VM, your VMs are configured in one computer,
where you call it as a server, any confusion, what is the actual point, actually if you remember
our discussion, the actual point is no scalability, scalability, so what is scalability, RPA systems,
if you are not, if it is not visible to you, so I am reading the statement,
so if you are an admin to RPA, the RPA systems must be able to grow and scale to meet performance goals
based in the expected increasing, in the volume of the robot transactions, data volume
and concurrency of the development, because see this year we are having 10 bots in my project,
next year we have had 20 bots, when it is 30 bots, because we are automating different processes,
and each process volume is increasing, right, so last year, so when we worked for one client,
so we started with 5 bots, now we have 60 plus bots, because client is happy with the RPA
implementation, he has the return on investment, so he is adding more and more bots, he is giving
more and more work to us, so definitely when setting up a RPA infrastructure, you need to remember
that in future it should be scalable, so any questions are confused on what is scalability,
what is scalability, sometimes we need to add more bots, why we are more bots,
because one bot may execute more processes, or one bot may execute more, more number of applications,
that that is the reason we need to add more bots, so one bot may fail to handle,
now all this volume, so I know it is not visible to you, so I will give you notes on this,
first I understand the architecture principles,
and this may not be enter you percent to RPA developer, you have to remember this
things by going to set up a reconstruction, so first difficult part in RPA, use a selection,
second difficult part, technical design, third one script development, fourth one scripted
deployment with the proper architecture and infrastructure, scripted deployment with the
proper architecture and infrastructure, okay, in a bit, fine, can I want to know next topic,
few more questions, where we can install the control room component, control room also you can
install in the same server, so control room also just a client application, so you can install
and control room also in the same server, or if you want control room you can install in a different
server, so next principle, next principle, performance, RPA system must be able to
meet throughput and efficiency goals, you have a dramatic improvements in accuracy, see,
while setting up the infrastructure, while setting up the infrastructure, you have to understand,
you have to understand, you know, performance also, you have to consider performance,
that means, which is the correct wise to see, all your VMs are in some machine, right,
some server or machine or computer or laptop, somewhere you installed your VMs, that VM,
VM infrastructure and that you know the server which boasted the VM, server must have the VM,
that infrastructure also you need to consider for better performance,
so lot of questions that one team will ask us, how many ports you install, 10 or 20,
what is the job of the each port, how many applications each port will execute per day,
we need to provide such data, based on that they come up with both the, okay, so go with this
much RAM, go with this much, you know, hard disk, server capacity, so you need to consider
and the third one will be, you know, security, see, this is the most important topic in all the
principles, because especially banking projects, you know, any client, RPN tools are going to
interact with the production systems and going to work on the production data, RPN tools are going
to work with the production systems, means, so we have automated loan tracking process in SBA,
your bot is going to get your, your original data, customer original data will be accessed
by bot, bot is a third bot is software to bank, blue person is a third bot is software to bank,
so definitely if you go to any sensitive clients or big dependencies, they will rise this concern,
so yes, we are ready to implement RPA, but that RPA implementation should be
aligned with our security standards, so each client has its, their own security standards,
each client has their own security standards, example, example, if you go to bank of America,
JP Morgan, that's for both, those are the banking clients, those are the banking clients,
what they do, so what they do, they give loans, they process credit cards, they handle with
pin numbers, so lot of, you know, sensitive data they handle, earlier, so bank employees
used to handle their sensitive data, now some of the scenarios, we automatically buy bots,
and bots is going to handle their sensitive data, so for just for RPA infrastructure,
see, they have lot of so many questions on security aspect, how bot will log into my web application,
how bot will log into my web application, from where you will install the bot, is it in banking
server, or other than banking network, so I am not going to touch this point now, I have a
separate one hour, today 6 to 7 I will talk only about security, just try to understand,
so while setting up a RPA tool selection, RPA architecture design, RPA infrastructure setup,
you have to consider scalability, performance, security, the next feature is maintainability,
what you mean by maintainability, maintainability means, we have developed the script,
we have deployed the script in the bot, so bot is installed in VM,
your bot is executing now, so your bot is executing, suddenly, you know your source
are target application modified, process is modified, in simple process is modified,
so we need to repair the script, so we have to do some repair of the script, so suddenly,
our process is modified, so we need to repair of the script, process can be modified, or you know,
trying this, expecting more performance improvements to RPA scripts, so some changes,
so if any new changes comes, your RPA infrastructure should be easy to, you know, deploy the new scripts,
easy to deploy the new versions of the same script, that is called maintainability, script
to modification should be easy process, the new version of the script should be deployed in
dev environment, testing environment, you have to reproduction, production in easy way,
support should be easy, support should be easy, so maintainability, so this is all important
features, maintainability, change control, so what do you mean by change control, any new version
of the script should be easy to add, easy to deploy, how we do that we will discuss,
next availability, so availability, see availability means, let us say if you go on top of the
client, so you can propose what is difference between human process execution, human process execution
and RPA execution, what is the difference between, execution between human and RPA,
generally we will tell, if it is human execution, one human can one FDA can execute 8 hours per day,
but robot can execute 24 by 7, this is a statement with you, it is a wrong statement,
because your bot also requires some downtime, for no refresh, for depth to load the new data,
to deploy the new script, to deploy the new script, so always you have to propose bot an
executive process, you know 22 hours, 223 hours of downtime is expected for a day,
223 hours of downtime is expected for a day, so your bot may not execute 24 by 7,
but try to see, bot should be available most of the time, may not be 24 hours,
but it should not be less than 20 hours, only 22 hours of downtime is allowed,
for bot refresh, so always bot should be, bot's availability is important,
even they ask questions about disaster recovery, disaster scenario, what even the disaster scenario,
let us say all your bots are installed in VMs, all your VMs are deployed in one computer,
that computer is crashed, or server crash, and all the bots are executing critical processes,
suddenly the server crash, suddenly the server crash, so then what happens,
so while setting up infrastructure, you need to go with active scenario crisis scenario,
so we need to have a separate infrastructure setup, so we call it as a disaster recovery,
so we discuss the disaster recovery from 526 as part of availability, that we discuss as part of
availability, surrounding one bot is not running, all the bots are not running,
server crash, bot crash, internet failed you, virus on it, some virus is blocking our bots,
not to execute, so what happens, we call it as a availability, so that is now you will discuss one
one more, then you know, so one more principle is, so operability,
so what kind of you know, so you can install all your bots in any virtualization technology,
you can install by using VM web, storage, next, gen desktop, hyperb, hyperb is from Windows,
so while configuring your VM, so go with virtualization technology, so that you know,
if you go with this kind of thing, it is easy to scale up, so all your bots are installed in the VM,
VM has to be configured with VM web or it is done desktop or hyperb, so this all of them,
we call it as in admin language, we call it as a mounting software, or we call it as a
configuration tool, it is a VM configuration, this topic is some central VM configuration,
so these are eligible, VM web, Citrix, gen desktop, hyperb, so even I will touch this one,
and this recoverability, so when a server crash happens, how fastly this can be recovered,
so what is the recoverability scenario, and one more important topic is presentation layer automation,
what will be presentation layer automation, presentation layer automation means these bots interact
with the source and target application UI layer only, so what is the bot job, so you are writing
script right, so you are extracting the data from excel interface, you are extracting the data
from out loop, you are extracting the data from web loop, so you are extracting the data from
different different user interfaces, so all these tools work on presentation layer only,
so these are the known some of the principles, technology, architecture, principles in our team,
at least, so write down the major points, what are the technology, architecture, principles,
scalable, performance, security, maintainability, availability,
operability, recoverability, presentation layer automation,
so this class you know mainly we address this kind of points only right, so with more practical
approach, so at least see just for time being, no need to write this description,
at least what are the technology, architecture, principles in our team,
scalable, performance, security, maintainability, availability, operability, recoverability,
presentation layer automation, now, now we are going to know technology, architecture, assumptions,
so there are also assumptions also, you know, you have to remember, you know, at your admin,
your project, RPA admin has to remember, you know, these assumptions,
while setting up the infrastructure, the first assumption is,
training may be normal, always you know, training may be normal, we will run on the developer
workstation, so you know, we should have a training may be normal for RPA, it's a new technology,
so our our advisor new to this technology, so any kind of RPA and training can happen
only on the developer workstation, developer workstation, set key assumption, so don't use your
testing environment, the UIT environment, production environment for training, RPA training,
then robot failover, failover scenario means, we have 10 bots,
suddenly one bot is not executing, or two bots are failed, three bots are failed, you have to
hardware crash, internet failure, whatever it is, if some number of bots are failed, if some number
of bots are failed, it is better to have an additional 25% of additional bots, so while giving
quotation to client, you need to remember that, let's say, actually you need 10 bots, but better
add, you know, 25% extra to 10, so 10%, so 10% to 10%, 25% more bots, you know, you give that,
that means, further we need to set up 14 bots, so this is one assumption,
so virtualize the desktop, so there is an IT support model in place for virtualize the desktop,
so because we are going to install all our software in VMs only, so your company should have
no VM setup, our professionals who knows how to set up the VM by using different technologies,
Windows VM is hyper VM, so Windows VM, they call it hyper slash VM, our Citrix gen desktop,
that is from Citrix, like this there are different providers, VM providers are available in the market,
and you know, even in RPA project, it is better to have a testing system,
always testing environment should be available, because most of the times we see in real time,
the steps which we develop in development, RPA developer documentation are failed in production,
so it is better to have the no separate test system,
and you need to do enough volume of the test data, test data volume is also important,
unfortunately this is one of the current RPA scenario in real time, I know some companies where
they started RPA implementation, they failed in RPA implementation, they got very negative
feedback on the lines, because they have not tested that script with enough volume,
they kept it with the testing with 1,2 scenarios, 1,2 samples of data, they developed directly
in the client environment, so bought failed to execute, so always while going up to set up the
infrastructure, so we need to load enough test data to test the script you developed,
for example, one script you developed is copy the data from excel sheet, load into
SAP server, or copy the data from excel sheet, load to out loop, that is what you automated,
you tested with two records in excel sheet, it is working fine, but when it is copying one
that records from excel sheet, it might fail, that is what I am talking, so try to understand
the scenario, you have automated, what is the process you automated excel copy data from excel to
out loop, you tested with two records excel and it is working very high speed, but in real time
the scenario tested by the client in your real time copy one that records from excel sheet,
load to out loop, it will fail, so unfortunately so many RPA developers are not testing in
testing environment, not testing with the enough test data, not testing with the enough test data,
okay, so then one more thing, business, application, test instance, as will be used for
robot development, so again the same point, separate environments are important for
level test and innovating, and robots IDs can be set up in global active directory, see if
this robot ID, I will talk about robot ID security, so robot ID means, you know sometimes, you know
let us say we have multiple bots, so each bot should have a login details, user ID and
password, bot ID and password, we should be integrated to active directory, so that you know
if it gives you better security, you will detect this point in security class, so need
name and concurrent developer, how is estimated to be 100 total developers, you know see,
so how we view access to users, disaster recovery, configuration management, robot operating
uptime, so what is availability of the time, like this, no you need to, you need to
provide some assumptions by setting up the infrastructure, so these are some kind of assumptions,
you know we should have a testing environment, that is the robot failover, all these robots
should be deployed in the virtual desktop, VMs, testing data should be available, separate
environment should be available, each bot should be given with the ID, so access control,
disaster recovery, okay, so these are the some of the key assumptions in RPA project, RPA
administration, sir an RPA developer, go and remember all this is not required, just for
knowledge and tell, why I am conducting all this classes again and telling, if you attend
interview, so interview or interviewer, it should give a very good story, I have done the life cycle,
I have done the infrastructure, then you will get job very easy, that is why I am trying to govern
more and more points about architecture and all this topics, see assumptions know not so important,
but key requirements, key requirements, see always assume 99.5% excluding the normal maintenance
window, your bot should have 99.5% days of optile excluding the maintenance window,
excluding the maintenance window, so your bot should be always running,
except down, except maintenance, maintenance means refresh debt, new script deployment,
and this is one key requirement, see, now we have implemented, okay, let me tell you one process,
you know, for one of the client, one key process is automated or for one of the client,
one key process is automated, that key process is, there is that process purposes,
it will, you know, it will run the job, the job running will take one and a half hour time,
and that the job will talk to multiple systems during the running, once this job is successful,
then only, you know, so server is going to credit to employees, and that process generally runs on
every month last day, finally day of the monthly calendar, if your job finds that company employees
will not get the salaries, total number of employees are freelance, so we automated, earlier,
you know, the process was some, some kind of manual process, no, we automated, see,
we automated monitoring of the process execution by using RPA, but it is a critical process
to business, it is a very critical process to bank, now your parts are executing it,
but there should be a dedicated team, there should be dedicated RPA support,
the team should be available, because due to any reason, whether it is no exception,
or it is unknown exception, whether it is known exception, or unknown exception,
we bought failed to execute that process, immediately bought and sent a email to the
support team, so that support team will at least execute the plan well, for that instance,
so later RPA developer will fix the problem, or if it is my point, it is a critical process,
which is linked to SLE, we call in real time, linked to timeline,
at any cost, what has to complete that process execution by January 30th, February 28th,
kind of it, if bought failed to execute that process, at least employees has to execute it,
so even though you automate your process, if it is based on the
support team are required for RPA, trust me, by next year this time, at least
millions of RPA support teams will be in IT industry, currently RPA is in POS states,
then it will be in implementation, that then all the implemented projects requires RPA support
to projects, again the same story, support records and all those things, so here you see the key
requirement is, you know, if for 30% of the boards, which are critical to the business,
24 by 7 support team is required, but 35% of the boards, which are not so critical,
5 days per week, you know, 16 hours of support is required, two shifts, first shift and second shift,
for, you know, there are, so not so critical, not medium, very less significant processes,
so 5 days have been 8 hours of support is required, so in my, in my project,
if board fails to execute any task, do any result, it will send email to support RPA support
to team and RPA development team, RPA support to team, they will run it manually, the process
they will do it manually, or they initiate the world, world way of doing and development
team fix the stream, at least for next time, so what is the key requirement, all your
boards should be 99.5% available, no, no downtime, so except maintenance, support hours,
so even for RPA projects, we need to form a RPA support to team, third one, you know,
integration, inventory of applications that will be accessed by robots, so your board must
have access to all the source and target application, otherwise you are scripting or
developing correctly, but due to access issue, your entire process may be, you know, may not complete,
but may not complete the process, so you need to ensure the key requirement is, see,
your board, you know, so has to interact with the 10 source systems, so your board should have
login details of all the 10 source systems, it should be able to access data from the 10 source
systems, that is the third point, fourth point again, security, so again I am not talking about
security, where we work as active directory integration and all, all the boards should be
configured in VM, so that easy to scale up on a more availability, you form what is fine,
other boards must be able to shape the work which has to be done by the board one, which is fine,
even that one I will talk about the availability, see, hope you understand, these are the
points, if you are an RP admin, sir, I want to join RP admin course, I want to become RP admin,
earlier I was like, again, admin guy, I want to become a group rhythm admin, I want to become
automation admin admin, even without the jobs, but so as RP admin, you need to, you need to understand
some principles, assumptions and clear requirements, so these are the theoretical part you should know,
regarding RP admin station, so based on these points, based on these points, we will start
the discussion about the RP architecture, so above you understand the bit picture,
so lot of concepts you need to understand, setting up your RP infrastructure is not easy,
last one week we are trying to set up your RP infrastructure for one of the lines,
lot of emails were sending from admin team, security team, in my company we have admin team,
where they set up the admin infrastructure, server, cloud server, physical server, VM configuration,
VLAN, maintaining in the LAN, enable the port, all these things will not be admin team,
second team is security team, second team is security team, so we have to get approval from
the security team, otherwise you know it is not easy to install the VM, because if you see this
diagram, so last week they raise it this person to me, from now how many VMs you want,
two VMs, one computer you want two VMs, that they told me from now, one computer how many
IP addresses you have, one IP address, how many VMs you are installing, two VMs, each VM will
not get IP, so then how you put those two VMs in cable network, so this for each VM you want
communication, right each VM should be an internet, if you want to set up the internet,
VM is an internet unit, IP address to VM, further you go and talk to security team, they have to,
they have to recreate the security exception, then only we can come with one computer with multiple
VMs, like this lot of discussions, last one week we still it is undergoing, the daily have a
discussion, the next person, okay, VM we set up, what you want to install in VM blue
is blue prism, your own software or standard software for our company or separate software,
no it is a third party software, again security exception, I know you have the license,
you have purchased the license, but you cannot install the third party license like that,
so they are proved to be blue prism, excellent, now to install blue prism in VM you need operating system
to VM, right, so what operating system you want to install Windows 7, get the license, now you have
Windows 7 and you have blue prism, everything is installed, but this multiple clients to talk to
server, IIS has to install, so the most difficult part in my RPI journey I am working in RPI
from last more than one year, the most difficult part is infrastructure, development is easy,
use case understanding, process assessment is also easy, development is easy, deployment is
it, testing is easy, tools selection also is easy, the difficult part in RPI is infrastructure,
okay, how many VMs you want then install 10, excellent, then you know this server is cannot
support it, so if you want more than this capacity, again go on talk to 1, so 10, they have only
installed this kind of server, they can use the capacity of the server, so if you want to install
all the VMs in physical server, you write the ticket today, up 90 days it will be approved,
okay, you want to approve the ticket by 15 days, then go for cloud server, cloud server can be
installed in 15 days, so lot of discussions, why the problem is there is no dedicated RPI
admins in the market loop, it is RPI adventure, unfortunately currently RPI developers are doing
that is a confusing, I do not know about your career part, but if you are from admin background,
you learn blue algorithm admin course, I do not know who is offering that course, no one is offering
that course, but you do little bit R India and blue algorithm admin, you will be having very
bright future, very rare, in entire India I am working in one of the biggest embassy,
my company has lot of automation developers and we have hardly 10s of admins are available,
below 10 admins, we have 1000 hardware developers in my company, but 10 admins,
very rare, for admin it is very easy, blue algorithm setup, server setup, all these are very
easy for admin, anyway, okay, now slowly we will try to understand you know architecture for,
any blue algorithm follows three-dare architecture, client server database, client server database,
so what do you mean by client, so this is a typical simple communication blue algorithm,
client speaks to server, server channelize the connection to database to pull the data and
use it back to client, so what do you mean by client here, client means it can be a control room,
it can be interactive client or it can be runtime systems, these three are the clients only,
these are the clients only, these clients, you know, so this is easy, you know environment setup,
I will draw one more thing, bot 1, bot 1 VM, bot 2, bot 3, we go with three bots,
so these are installed in server 1, server 1 or machine 1, so why it is a confusion,
if one call it as a machine 1, and here in this machine 2 you install the control room,
you install the control room, and in machine 3 you install the database, generally database is
a SQL server, so typical database is SQL server, so bot 1 is executing a process called extract
the data from excel sheet, extract data from excel sheet, so when it is executing the process,
when it is executing the process, it will talk to control room, control room interacts with the
database server, it fetches the required data, it gives the data back to control room,
control room gives data back to, you know, so bot 1 to complete the process execution,
so that is why, no you call it as a three-tier architecture, multiple bots are in one machine,
control room is in one machine, and database server is in other machine,
sir, we are not having three computers in my company, our company is small company,
can I install all three in one machine you can install, that is what you are doing in your laptop,
but typically, so based on the number of bots, so you know, this is one machine 1,
just go, don't go with client server, you will confuse, machine 1, machine 2, machine 3,
here you have the database, you have the control room, you have the bots,
okay, logically, these are the three different physical servers,
this is one physical server, this is physical server 2, physical server 3,
what is the first physical server purpose to install VMs and install bots,
what you have, what is this control room installation, this is Gaby server,
how communication happens, this is installation, see installation is different,
communication is different, so installation is different, communication is different,
how installation happens, so this is the installation for season,
how communication happens, so bots will execute, according to the schedule,
you have mentioned in the control room, and while executing it, it talks to control room,
control room will send the requested to DB server, control room will send the requested to
DB server, so this is you know tire 1, tire 2, tire 3, so clients are restricted from accessing
the database directly, so clients can talk to control room, control room can talk to database server,
so even you can do this complete setup even in two machines, even in two machines you can do,
in one machine you can install the clients on, you know bots on control room,
in other machine you can install the database servers, installation is different, communication is
different, please don't get confused, okay, so for all your questions, I will discuss later,
just give me some time, okay, so coming to communication pod, see what happens in
typical clients on our architecture, whenever bots send a requested to, whenever bots send a request,
control room, you know, will send the requested to, control room is installed in IAS machine,
so it will send requested to IAS is a web server here, and you know from the request will be
possible to load balancer, which is in application server, and load balancer will send,
will get the data from the database and use it back to client, so typical three-tier architecture,
it's a typical, so group rhythm follows, typical three-tier architecture, you see this diagram,
see these all are my clients, these all are my clients, it is a dev client, it is an interactive
client, so all these will send no requested to application server, all these will send requested
to application server, application server request, this is the request from these clients,
and it sends requested to database server, database server will execute and it gets data,
it will give it will give back to application server, application server give back to client,
so client will complete the process, a typical three-tier architecture, any RPA technology
follows typical three-tier architecture, so client speaks to server, server
channelize the collection to database to pull the data and use it back to client,
so how many type of clients may have two clients, one is interact to client and runtime resource,
so these two are the clients in the architecture, you can see different, you know,
this is the infrastructure required, but we will go with this,
some infrastructure blueprint, so see just see the diagram, so I will understand the text,
see the diagram, a different view, a different view, see if you understand this then it is
more easy, your blue prism runtime resources and a blue prism interactive client,
you know, so they will send requested to application server,
application server will send requested to database server, it sends response back to application
server, application server will respond back to client, this is the typical three-tier architecture,
this is interactive client, this is interactive client, this is runtime resource,
so this is for developing the script, this is to run the script, so you draw this diagram,
so if you want even even get this liberty from Google also, it is a typical blue prism architecture
diagram, so typical blue prism architecture diagram, yeah, now we will start understanding one by one,
what is interactive client, what is runtime resource, what is application server,
what is database server, so these four components will try to understand one by one,
you know, this, see if anyone asks you to explain any RPA architecture,
blue prism interact to client, blue prism runtime resource, blue prism application server,
SQL server database, virtualization technology, active directory domain controller,
these are the six components which you have to explain and you have to draw this diagram,
so what is blue prism interact to client, what kind of no operating system we should have,
what is runtime resource, what is application server, what is database server,
what is virtualization technology, so what is active directory domain controller, so
that is my next one hour class, next one hour I am going to talk about only the components of
RPA architecture, till now I have given introduction to RPA architecture, kind of technology
principles, assumptions, key requirements, basic thing, now next one hour I am going to talk about
these six components, what is interactive client, what is runtime resource, what is application
server, what is database server, what is virtualization technology, what is active directory domain controller,
the next session is after discussing these components, so next one hour will be security,
security and disaster recovery of the blue prism, security and disaster recovery of the blue prism,
so now, so let us go for a break for nearly you know, now the time is 426, go for 20 minutes break,
after the break we will continue the discussion, see architecture and a class,
little bit tricky, okay, so you have to be very active in the class,
life is a challenge of opening, as a client in the server ever, so these are very very important
points and now we are going to next one hour is the actual architecture class, first of all
you will understand the client components, first you will understand the client components,
blue brism, blue brism, interactive client, plus blue brism, runtime resource,
our control room, all these three are the client components only, if it can be blue brism,
interactive client, our runtime resource, our control room, all these three are the client's only,
so generally what is the process, no interactive client sends requested to control room,
runtime resource also sends request to control room, control room will try to talk to database,
okay, see, again, say please try to understand, you know, for me you know there are three types of
clients, there are three types of clients, you know, client one where you develop the script,
it will talk to control room, okay, so of developing the script you can deploy in the control room,
right, then interactive, so runtime resource which executes the process, how it executes the process
by interacting with the control room, so logically your server will receive request only from control room,
see, your server will receive request only from control room, because there is no
direct correction between runtime resource and the server, there is no direct correction between
runtime resource and the server, runtime resource interacts with control room, control room
will send the request to database, the request, so is it clear now, so the request which is sent
by the control room will be received by application server, who will receive the request,
application server, so please don't get confused between control room and application server,
which is sent request to server, so which server will receive the request,
application server, application server receives the request from control room, this is
only in the script, you have to understand, then there will not be any confusion,
generally why, why, even even in real time my colleagues are also get confused, because
they think that this is server 1, server 2, server 3, no, see, these are the server set up for
installation, not for communication, if you have this clarity then story will be very easy,
understand architecture, logically I have installed my clients, my servers in three components,
three machines, for me machine 1, machine 2, machine 3, machine 1, I installed the course,
machine 2 control room, machine 3 database, machine 3 database, now,
which will try to talk to database control room, so now there will be control room is
client or server client, it is a client, you install a server, say server, why we are talking about
server, server is a physical component, server is a physical component where you install control room,
somewhere you have to install control room, so you install control room on physical server,
right, so control room, control room or control center, control room or control center,
it sends request to applications server, it sends request to applications server,
why application server required control room, see very, so for the late journey,
say I am talking about simple topic, because this is this needs, this understanding is required,
can runtime resource, can runtime resource try to talk to database, no,
who will send request to database control room, so interactive client and interactive client,
runtime environment, these are not sending request to server, so I have two components
in architecture, there it will be very easy to understand, component one is control room,
component two is database, I have two components, how control room sends request to database,
it requires a medium, that medium is called application server, in your application server,
there is a physical hardware called load balancer, there is a component called load balancer,
what is the purpose of the load balancer, or I will give you one more very, very general example
to understand this architecture, you open a browser, use enter google.com, your browser is
client, your browser is client, you are sending request to server, what is the, which server
receives request, DB server or application server, so server or application server, so these will receive
the request, so in the same way, just you replace browser with bot or control room, you replace
the browser with control room, control room sends request to database server, but database server
cannot handle threats, so which will, which will component will receive application server,
in application server, there is a concept called load balancer, which automatically receives
the request, send the response to database, or send response back to clients, I do not know
the complexity in this topic, very simple concept, control room interacts to app server,
apps are our interacts to database, apps are our interacts to database, control room,
application server, database server, no, we will discuss one by one, no multiple, no more details
about each component, so let us start our discussion about interactive client, so what is
interactive client, so interactive client means, no it typically requires standard windows
desktop operating system emails, with business client applications and blockers installed,
so who will use this interactive client, developers, rp8 developers,
use interactive client to develop the script by automating the processors,
so what is required, so what is required, what is required, standard windows operating system emails,
with the business client applications and blockers installed, what you mean by business client
applications, what you mean by business client applications, business client applications means,
your excel, your web, your PDF, your SAP, what your automate, so all this has to be installed
in the interactive client, okay, so used by blockers developers, in one is to one ratio,
one group reason developer must have, one interactive client installed,
to build a test to the process in development and test environment, use it by process controllers
to control and monitor the runtime resources in production environment, so see you develop
the script, so you have to deploy it to control room, so the control room can execute in runtime,
so virtualization is can be recommended, even you know these blockers interact with client
also can install in the VM, and this is the minimum configuration, this configuration may
change from version to version, so now you are using version 5 point, the latest version of
blockers in 5 point, 0 point 8 something, in my company we are using 5 point, 0 point, 0 or 1,
I think 1, 0 point 1 we are using, so but the latest is 0 point 8 something, the recent
version is wrong, 5 point 0 point 8 some new version is 1 8, so in there, so these are the
configuration, minimum configuration required for your machine to install the interactive client,
now by canceling the youngest industry RPA, this is a question now, but later you know everyone
knows, this is not a point to do business, so these are the, you know here you can see this
diagram, so you know control room, you know developer, see blue brism developer can develop
this script in interactive client, you can do scheduling through control room, so if it will
interact with, you know there will, you can see this, this line, you can see this, you know
your blue brism interactive client has direct connectivity to automobiles, but you see this line,
so you are automating this application, but your blue brism interactive client is not having
direct connectivity to automobiles, it has to integrate with the, it has to interact with
the circuits, then only interact with the application, so to automate these kind of applications,
you need to use surface automation, where you extract the image and work on image operations,
right, so this is an example for surface automation, so interactive client have two types of
connectivity to automation, one is direct connectivity, other one is surface automation,
so any questions on this point, blue brism interactive client means a software which you will
start in your workstation, which will use for develop the strips, blue brism interactive client,
okay, I have a question here, then I use blue brism interactive client as runtime resource,
yes, but it is more fast, by using interactive client you can develop, you can test, you can run,
but why you use runtime resource just to execution, so I can say runtime resource is having
the subset of features compared to interactive client, interactive client is having more features,
you can develop, you can test and you can run, but in runtime resource you can only execute,
so basic point, but still I am stressing, some students may not understand it clearly,
so can I move on to next slide, this is one component in architecture, see this is architecture
diagram, I am talking about this component, these are the clients, why we use clients,
develop, test, schedule, monitor, report, execute, we use these two, so when I say client means,
client means interactive client control room runtime, these three are the clients,
so most of the students are having confusion, control room client or serverer client,
it is a client, but it is installed in some server, it communicates to application server,
it communicates to application server, so any clarity you want the organism interactive client,
any questions, so how many types of automation we can do by using interactive client,
direct connectivity, surface automation, direct connectivity, surface automation,
so basically control room in a very good question, the question is control room comes with interactive
client license or it is a separate license or it comes with runtime resource, that is the question,
in blue prison, you will get one setup means, they will view license, let us say if they if you
buy one port in blue prison, they will give you one interactive client, one control room,
which is back to one database, so there is no separate cost for interactive client and runtime port
and you know control room, but in automation in a way, in automation in a way, even to initial setup
of your RPA, you need to buy interactive client separately, runtime resource separately, control room
supply, but in scaling them, in scaling them, so now I have initial setup, in blue prison,
I have initial setup, I have five developers, we bought five interactive clients, which are
integrated to one or control room, but I want more blue prison runtime resources, then you can
scale it up, okay, see in automation in a way, each component you have to pay the money,
so each bought each control room, you have to pay the money license, license cost will be there,
but in in blue prison, initial setup will come if you buy one port in blue prison, one interact
token, they will give you control room, but scaling them, but scaling them means, you know if you
want 10 runtime resources in groupness, you need to pay each groupness in cost, each runtime
resource cost, and one more point here, how many control see, I have no, I have 10 bots which are
connected to control room, I have 10 bots which are connected to one control room, can I maintain
Tauyan bots to one control room? No, it affects their performance, so logically according to
RPS standards, one control room can see, can be one control room, can control 100 bots,
that is the RPS standard, for example you have 200 bots, each bot is doing very simple process
automation, even 200 bots also can be connected to one control, that is the standard, so next question
okay, so you have 100 bots which is integrated to one control room, then one application server is in
you have more bots, more transactions, and more control rooms, so then you need to maintain more
than one application server, based on the number of bots, how many control rooms are required,
how many applications are required, based on the bots, and its transaction, and its load,
yes, because it is the client, you can connect 10 control rooms also to one
application server, or multiple application servers, so all these are no architecture, design is
important actually, these has to be considered, okay, so any questions are interactive client,
then I have more to runtime resource, so this is my interactive client, so what we do with interactive
client, develop the script, test script, run the script, monitor the script, okay, so
what is runtime resources, here you see runtime resource, so the purpose of the runtime resource is
you know which executes the process in real time, here you see the diagonal, no need to go in the
text, so you see the diagonal, which executes the process, which executes the process in real time,
okay, so it will do process execution, so it will interact with you know source and
nonprofit applications, direct connectivity or septic selectivity, no it will receive the request,
and it will you know it will talk to control room, control room will send a request to the
application server, application server will send request to database server, so the runtime
resource purpose is, for the people who are not able to see this, so this is the runtime resource
purpose, it runs only unattended auto-maker process, again as target applications often referred
to as the robot on a single virtual machine, in one within one VM you can install one bot,
how many bots are required, how many runtime resources are required, how many runtime resources are
required, based it on the number of processes you have, based on the volume of the applications you
have, that is the first point we discussed in today's class, how many runtime resources we have,
so can see one bot that executes 500 applications per day, in 24 hours, can we ask the same
bot that executes 500 applications, no, targeting my point, see, you have five developers in
your company, so five interactive clients, one control room, but how many bots I need, how many
run, when I say bot runtime resource, how many runtime resources I need, that depends upon the
number of processes you have automated, and no process execution time and volume, process execution
time and volume, again I am telling, this is important point, any runtime resources license this
for Ali, E person where you, any interact to, how to understand the difference, if you go
or can go with the engine, I am trying my level best, sorry, if one bot is receiving only
item, remaining what is it means, we can use for other course, yes, we will go to the
discussion, see the concept is, no, I have one bot which is installed in one being, the bot job is
continuously check the email, if you get the email, then copy the email, content, copy the email
attachments to open the email attachment, copy the data to excel ship, you know, this is the job,
this is the process, I have one bot, it has to do 24 hours the same job, it has to continuously
do the same job, so I have one process, the process is the same process and it is installed in
one bot, the script is installed in one bot, the bot is busy, 24 hours on the bot is busy,
it is running throughout the day, can you use the same bot to automate to run other job,
no, can one bot execute two processes simultaneously, no, because this RBA technology works on
presentation layer automation, what do you mean the presentation layer automation,
bot will exactly interact like a human to application, it is not interacting with database,
it is not interacting with middle level, middle layer, what is bot, what is RPA, RPA bot interacts
with any application like a human, so like a human means like FTA means open email, read,
check for the mail, if you get the email download the attachment, copy the data, load into
accession, that is what your bank employee is doing, so any RPA technology it works on,
it works on presentation layer automation, so the very very important interview question
can one bot execute two processes simultaneously, no means one bot is talking to excel sheet,
at the same time can it up to outlook, no, it can do execution step by step, here I have a
difference in our unit, I have one bot which has to execute one process daily morning 9 AM
and execution time one hour, the bot work will over 10 AM, so 10 to tomorrow 9 o'clock
the bot is free, it is not doing any, it is not assigned to execute any other process,
I have the second bot which is overloaded today, can bot 1 execute bot 2 work that is a person,
sometimes no, you can conflict like that but no means in your company there is a HR bot,
there is a finance bot, today HR guy is not having any one, can you can you use him to
process salaries, no it is not his skill, in some companies there is a restriction,
there is department wise bots, a bot which has to execute only HR processes,
a bot which has to execute only admin process, so even though HR department bot is free today,
finance process bot is busy today, still you have to go for second finance bot only, you
cannot utilize this, because this process is controlled restricted not to execute finance process,
bot 1 is restricted from not to execute other department process, in your program settings,
but logical answer I have 5 bots, one bot is overloaded, other bot is free,
so your scripts can be executed by any bot, logically true,
logically true, but there can be restrictions in real time, so all these things has to be
considered by technical architect, while designing the architecture, how this bot has to be
communicated to Sarmat, it depends upon the no scheduling of the process, initially it is not
tough question, but later on, next year if you come, most of the interview persons will be on this
point, because currently you know, currently we have, no we have taken one bot that bot is in
order, that is executing all the processes, because we automated only 10 use cases,
but in scenario your company has automated 1000 use cases,
can one bot execute all the only use cases, no, then how many bots are required,
which bot is available, it is a very good discussion list,
hope you got me, but it is not blindly, no one bot is free, so that the bot can execute
other process, no, sometimes there is a restriction at a bot level, bot 1 only allowed to execute
these systems, so already we discussed this point, the next point virtualization, so this is the
so this is the virtualization is recommended, so may able to quickly scale out and to have an
interview environment, that is fully virtualized an environment, so already we discussed this point,
so that you know it is better instead of installing your bot directly laptop or computer,
it is better to install it, so on we are all VMs in one computer as it is hyperb technology.
So, under these bots in the connectivity and access to all business applications,
so using for development and testing, typically runtime resource has to be you know,
typically it requires silent windows desktop operating system image with the business client
applications and group is installed, but can installed on windows server OS, so these are some
of the points about the runtime resources, any questions on runtime resource, can runtime
resource directly talk to application server, no, runtime resource will talk to application server,
no, so through control room, so these are the minimum requirements,
so these are the minimum requirements to set up the VM,
these are the minimum, so it is not an interview question, just like you know for non-adjumpity,
even I cannot remember right distance, okay, so if you have any questions please let me know,
otherwise we will move on to the next topic, that is called you know application server,
application server, so if I have 100 plus bots, then it is better to have two control rooms,
it is better to have two control rooms, 100 plus bots, not only even two control rooms,
right, let us say, let us say, I have 1000 bots, tell me, so in our architecture we design like this,
each 100 bot one application server, like that we design for 100 bots one application server,
so how many bots we have no 1000, and how many applications are also required,
10, in a positive scenario, but suddenly in 10 applications server, there is a chance that
one application server may get trash, hardware failure, one application server may be
structured due to any issue, so it is always better to maintain n plus one application servers
to receive the request from the clients, so first one, n plus one, that means ideally unit 10,
but it is better to put on the level of application servers, so any one application server is known,
that work will be distributed in other current servers, it is not like that plus one is for
download server, n application servers, what any one server is known, that server work will be
distributed to other 10, total level, one is known, so many are available 10,
so blue prism application server, even you can say this, so how it receives the request,
see here you can see in this diagram, how many applications servers we have,
two applications server one, applications server two, why, if this server fails, this is a backup,
this is a backup, so every time when clients send a request, it will go to main server
and backup server also, suddenly if it is down due to any no decent disaster happened in
hurricane in the US, so one of the city banks servers are in that location,
entire city bank operations, admin station work is happening from that location,
so they should have a business continuity plan from Singapore or some way,
so this is the main server, this is the backup server, so in minimum case also, worst case also,
how many applications are also required, two, n plus one, one is minimum number two,
one is for active, one is for backup,
suddenly if this is the main server, this is down, how this boss will communicate to this server,
based you have to manual connection or if you can set it as automatic process,
it means heavier of this job, so this is a typical architecture, so this is for main scenario,
this is for disaster scenario, okay, now let us talk about the important points of
application server, should talk about, see, Balaji, again now you are getting confused,
control room is one client, it is kind of a interactive client, no it is a client, control room is
a client, which is since requested to application server, control room is a client, which is since
requested to application server, if you want to see, you know Balaji has to see control room,
so wait Balaji, I will show you, can you see control room here, it is a client, that is not
empty, so fine, okay, so these are the points about the application server,
so what is application server, so always it is better to maintain and plus one application server,
and you know one server can service 100 clients, that means one application server can
receive request from 100 runtime bots, via control room, via control room, if more bots are connected
to one control room, or you know then more control rooms are sending request to application server,
then one application server is not enough, it is better to maintain multiple parallel
application servers, to improve the performance, to improve the performance, application servers are
using the same queue from a single database, that means you have more than one application server,
but one database, see, two application servers are connected to one database, so how they receive
the, they receive the response from the database, they maintain the same queue, use this word,
application servers using the same queue from the single database, so suddenly one application
server is down, so other application servers are also using the same queue, then so there is no
complaint, see this, so application servers using the same queue from the single database,
provides point to tolerance, since if one application server is shut down,
another application server can become the toss from the same queue, and retrieve the toss that
have the status incomplete, this is guarantee introducing, guarantee introducing, I have 10 bots,
10 bots are connected to application server 1, see we will go with some bigger picture,
I have 10 bots, lemon application servers, one database, suddenly randomly one application server
is down, but the application server is in middle of handling one toss, it is giving some response
back to client, it is down, whenever it is down, in application server all these application servers
are connected to same queue, if any application server is down, the jobs which are hand-in-path
application server will be marked as a incomplete, so that other application server can complete that job,
this is the question, guarantee goes in, application servers using the same queue from a single database
provides point to tolerance, since if one application server shut down, another application server
can pick up the toss from the same queue, and retrieve the toss that have a status incomplete,
you can't see it's automatic, there is a load balance set, there is a load balance set,
so application server configuration job, that is, in application server, how to configure
the application server, it is a force actual, web logic, you know there are so many application
servers, so that guy will take care of it, so application server configuration, internal talk with the
this, so application server can be configured manually or automatically, so where we call it as a
load balance set, they use different algorithms called round drive and algorithm,
there are different algorithms on which server is handling on which toss,
how the toss is allocated, see queue miss bucket, so there are different tosses,
which server has to work on which toss, they have each application server has a some algorithms
called round drive in kind of algorithms, so that means a way of it, so that's the internal
configuration applications, but you got the clarity rate, control room is different,
application server is different, control room is a client, which sends requested to,
application server or servers, based upon the number of ports each control room is having,
and one more point about application server, the blue prism server,
service installed, which shields database connection, details from the connected clients,
implements encryption and holds the scheduler, what is the purpose of it, blue prism server,
service installed, which shields database correction, so why we are sending to, why clients are sending
requested to application, why clients are sending request to database server, why application server,
because security, main business security, see the blue prism server service installed, which
shields database connection, details from the connected clients, so can any client directly
interacts with database, no that is called three type, client app server, then database server,
that is called three type, so this is the reason why we are sending request from clients to
application server, then to database server,
yeah, see she gone, second application server will continue from where first application server
left, see just, just consider there is a queue, there is a bucket or queue, where multiple
people working on that, suddenly one people fail to complete the job, then the job will still
in the queue, it will remain as a incomplete, because it failed to complete it, so other three people
will complete the job, the same concept, if application server completes the task, then it
marks as complete, so other application server will not touch it, right, so the same concept,
there is no other complex topic here, so if any job, see suddenly one application server is executing
one process, it is incomplete, so why it is incomplete, server is clash, so that it will be marked as
incomplete in the bucket, queue, we call it as a queue, server queue, so other servers will pick it,
other servers will pick it, all incomplete jobs will be picked by other server,
where it is left, it will continue, so hope that address you around, you will answer to your
questions, right, so this is the purpose, why we have send, why clients are sending requests to
application server, fine, so on your application server, you know, it is one server can handle 100
even, see this, one application server failover can happen, basic level of failover contingency
in case of application server failuries supported by using multiple application server, don't go
by one application server, n plus 1, n plus 1, so what is the minimum configuration required,
dual intel processor, if other servers are also busy while collapsing one server, how
what will execute the task, so you need to see, that is why we are going with n plus 1,
so we are going with n plus 1, we are not going with n server, I want one server, but I want
another backup to n plus 1, so that is one assumption we should go while setting up the infrastructure,
so yes, hope yes work, hope it is clear to you, so always it is better to go for additional servers,
fine, so this is the minimum infrastructure required to set up the application server,
4GB RAM, 200GB free disk space, this is the minimum requirement,
see this statement, very good statement, see all these concepts trust me,
so very few people in real time will use, because see in my project I am the RPA lead or manager
whatever it is, so it is my responsibility to set up the infrastructure, I am working with
30 plus team, they are not bothered about it, I am raising the request, I am talking to
admin team, I am talking to server setup team, I am talking to security team, because it is my job
as a lead, but I have 30 developers under me, they are coming to office, they do automation
they need, for them they are least bothered about improv, so it is only leads job to set up the
infrastructure, but again I am telling most of people are here to put some at least one year fake
experience in RPA, so if you know life cycle architecture infrastructure, tools compares
to live projects, you will get a good story, so that you can explain to interviewer, right, so
just a second, first you understand this one, but the multiple program application servers
using a single database, a failover, a failure in one application server,
can automatically fail over to another application server,
if you are not able to understand this statement, then join spoken English classes in a minute,
it does not deal with anything with IT, okay, depending on the complexity of the robot,
it may still require manual steps to investigate at which step the failure occurred,
and if manual steps are needed to complete the robot task, that is why, if any client to fails,
if any transaction, if any script fails, if any server fails, immediately RPA support
team and RPA info team, RPA developer team will get email, to fix that problem,
so any confusion on application server, client server communication,
like that application server also in another server or any other these three missions,
yes perfectly fine, now you got the point, installation is different, communication is different,
you can install all these three in one computer, but if computer is gone, then you will
lost everything, so you will start everything in one physical server, your bots, you will start,
your application server, you will start your database server, all three components you will start
in one computer, if that clash happens, then everything you will lose, so it is better to physically
install in three missions, all clients in one server, control room in one server, and app server
is in one DB server in another mission port, yes fine, that is why I am I am stressing one point,
installation, communication is different, even I am not admit, even I am not expert in admit,
I am trying my level quest to tell you infrastructure, because that is my job in my company now,
especially last one week I am struggling like anything, they are asking different different
puzzles, which I am not aware of it, what is Hyper-V, what is VM, what operating system you have
to install, what is load balancer, this all are not my subject, okay, so this answers your question,
is it automatic configuration manual?
See, the redundancy and failover needs, the redundancy and failover needs,
needs of the application server needs to be analyzed at the application server level,
but also at the database server level plus the fault tolerance capabilities means,
you know see while setting up infrastructure you have to analyze, you know how many application
servers are required, how this has to be interacted with client, so what is the few concept,
that is why they given the extra statement, so you may use, you know third party mechanisms,
you have to use, so to maintain application servers are to divert, you know to interact
and articulate one multiple client's application server, use DNS round-drawing network load balancing
can be supported by blue prism application servers to offer automatic failover capabilities,
so if you want to learn what is DNS round-drawing and network load balancer because it works
with J boss, Tomcat courses, so these are the internal algorithm supported by blue prism application
server, not only blue prism, just for name, I am talking about blue prism, any server,
see this, this is also a very good point, for example, you have 100 bots, each bot is executing
one process, each process is very critical to the business like, you know a very critical process,
if that bot phase, the server phase, the business is gone, very important to client,
like running any critical system like, you know, aeroplane or related softwares are kind of
very critical business, it has to be treated like any cost, so then the redundancy and failover
features, how many additional servers are required to set up, it depends upon the critical robots
there and the criticality of their associated process, based on that even you can maintain
n plus 2 application servers, n plus 2 application servers also can maintain,
that depends upon the criticality of the business and budget you have, it is the perfect
reason, so, couple of any, any person on that voting, so far nothing,
run, run, run, so there is no complexity here, bots are integrated to application server,
our application servers we have to maintain, that depends upon the what are the parameters,
how many critical bots you have and depends upon the associated criticality of their associated
business process, so this is called high availability, if you have more application servers,
then server town time will be 0, if you remember principles availability,
scalability, security, these are all the principles, so can I mount other component,
so clear, is it clear, see, what you mean by client, control room, see, control room is connected
to, finally, who is exhibiting the process bots, how they are exhibiting, they communicate
to control room, control room communicate to server, server means application server, it will send
to database, so if you are clear with the application server, I will move on to fourth topic
called database server, the next component, database server,
so this is database server, you know here you can see database server or data center,
you call it as a data center or database server, whatever it is,
so we will let you point the server,
the blue algorithm, you know database is a central repository, which holds process definitions
and audit information, as well as configuration data, such as anywhere on a wide spectrum sentence,
you know in blue prism, everything will be stored in database, including your blue prism code,
XML, including code, in automation everywhere, code can be integrated to SVN,
but user information, data, all that, no process data, so example, example,
first of all, you know first you try to log into no control room or any client, see who will
validate, so once you click on client and try to enter some, you will try to enter some user
ID password, so try to log into control room or try to enter some user ID or password,
when you try to enter user ID and password, if you are authenticated then only you are allowed to
log in, so how it is authenticating, how it is authenticating, so you enter some user ID
and password, it will match this information to database, but you should have, so your user
details in the database, how you log into source application, source application is Gmail,
so Gmail log in details will be stored in the database, so any data,
so in blue prism, even the code is also directly stored in the database, in blue prism everything
is integrated to database only, entire XML files also will be in database, so the point is very
clear, so what is the purpose of the database server, so blue prism database is a central repository,
which holds process definition, all ever process information, any data and audit information,
login details, configuration of the data, such as environment-wide systems settings,
so all this data will be stored in the database server, database server, so database server,
database performance and capacity can be easily scaled up, so you can add it, so the database
is specific to blue prism environment and therefore within an organization there may be a requirement
to host number of databases based on the number of independent production environments,
this is important point, okay, I have two projects for HSBC, project one is auto-mitting the
loan process, project two is auto-mitting some other finance process, so automatic loan process
and auto-mitting the finance process, I have two different different projects altogether,
so you can set up, you know, you can set up different, you know, database servers,
so complete environment set up can be different, so only to maintain one data center for all
blue prism types, so you may set up multiple environments, so this is one classification,
other one, I have one other scenario, scenario is, I have only one project, but dev environment,
extra environment, UI dev environment, production environment, all these four environments
need database, for all those four environments you can integrate to one database server,
where database server can be partitioned into different regions, dev environment database,
so there can be partitioned into different regions, so can we maintain multiple database servers,
yes, because you have two different projects in our company, you have created two different database
servers, but can we need multiple database servers, can we need multiple database servers,
for one project not required, testing also can be configured, so only then database has to be
partitioned into different regions, so generally blue prism or any RPA tools, they are built on
SQL server database, so close proximity of the SQL server to blue prism application server,
another blue prism resources, so what is the size, no capacity required for the database server,
you can see here, so we will try to understand important points, for example, for example,
database, data center itself is crashed, then see in this diagram how many data servers you have,
it is also installed in one computer, right, so if it crashes,
then can any port can run, can we run any port, no, so again, so to address this point,
we have, this is the scenario, so where we call it as, these are the developer clients,
they are interactive client control room, okay, so these are the runtime resources,
integrated to multiple application servers, and even each application server can be integrated to
show you one more diagram, see, see this is your main scenario, this is your disaster recovery,
that means in my, in my project we are maintaining two database servers, each request will pass through
two database servers, but one will be in main front, and I mean one is main active scenario,
other one is the backup, we suddenly main data center down, then we can, on this spot,
we can directly connect to, the other one because it is an Italy of,
Italy of the main data center every second, it is a every second replica,
so each request will pass through two data centers,
so it is just an Italy cover, right, so this is the scenario you have to explain,
so this is the high availability and disaster recovery scenario,
high availability and disaster recovery scenario,
so this is the main scenario, even in the main scenario itself,
if any application server crash happens, it was an additional server,
so the entire post down, data center is down,
so this is the production environment, if you are working on a critical process automation,
critical RPA project, this is the scenario you have to propose to connect,
like this they have to set up the infrastructure,
a critical banking project, if you want to decide to RPA implementation,
so I really do relate this, it is a costly process, additional infrastructure,
if this goes down, if this goes down, then you know the backup, if this is down,
if this entire setup is wrong, so this is the business continuity plan,
so this is the infrastructure server, you have to propose to clients,
really persons, this should be the production environment,
so these are all the parts which are executing, so if any work is fine,
then these bots will additional bots, this entire story is down, this is the disaster scenario,
disaster recovery scenario, so I want the setup which should work 24 by 7,
always my bots should continuously executing, no down 10, but it is a costly process,
and this is not a new topic in RPA, this is a typical topic in administration,
gaining project infrastructure, yes, now we discussed about the power movements,
so open to discussion, then I will move on to the next topic called security,
which is very very important in RPA, so RPA and security, so this is what I am interested in,
so security, connectivity, so there are some points in, I want, I carried some time,
at least half an hour to 45 minutes time I need, so in terms of infrastructure and mainly security
topic I want to cover, with this you will understand the architecture part, no, so any
questions on these four components, in RPA administration, so any questions on the
RPA administration, so you understand you know DB component, so if you have more than 100 robots,
so we maintain two different applications server, but these two applications are also
collected to one common database server, can we install client, our applications are
in same machine, yes you can install but not recommend them, if you have more than 100 robots
then what should be the infrastructure, so this is the internal process,
so we discussed about all these components, all the 100 robots work at the same time, yes,
not 24 by 7, 3 hours down time, so see, our 100 robots can execute different processes,
but one robot cannot execute more than one process at a time,
can we learn 15 processes from plate same plate in parallel, no,
can we learn 15 processes from same plate, no, more than one process, no,
but only there is exception in mind frames, so because see why we cannot execute more than one
process from one robot, because all these bots work on UI thread,
all these bots work on UI thread, the exception is sometimes it is executing old mind frames,
so you can keep and ask your bot to execute two processes also, that is only exceptions are you,
generally can one bot, can we learn more than one process from the same plate in parallel,
this is the question, they are not the interview question, can we learn more than one process
from same kind in the in parallel, no, so surface talenters will talk about that,
these are the architecture components we are discussing, so these topics are, this topic is
spending active directory domain controller, auto login agent, security, this topics I am
going to cover, but basic components but is specifically what is interactive line,
what is runtime resource, what is application server, so what are the cloud requirements,
you know for RPA full cloud no problem, but hybrid cloud is a problem, so entire infrastructure
either you have to maintain in cloud or you have to maintain in the local, don't go into hybrid
cloud, that means 10 patients are in edu, 10 patients are in other cloud is not
go with one cloud setup, so this is the database, so what is the size of the database server,
so what is size of the database server, size of the database server based on the transaction law,
transaction law, so how much time if we have taken to store the process data, so transaction law,
so if you have already used transaction law then it is go for more database servers,
I mean it is the size of the database server, so while robot types are installed in virtual
machine, is this capability and is in maintainability, I want to create 10,000 robots, do I need 10,000
laptops to install, no go for virtualization, that is called virtualization technology,
VM, so VDA or VM, so active directory, controller, security, this drop itself,
so how RPA tools ensures the security, I need some time,
this points also with this, see this document we are giving as a material to you,
so this is the material I have prepared RPA administration, so this material we are giving
as a material to you, so for online students we will upload in our website or some way you can
browse it, I cannot send a software, you will say I am not, see this technologist will continuously
change and even I know I will change continuously, I will upgrade my knowledge of continuously,
but the problem will be in time, so whenever we send this software is some students are
misusing it, so we have some bad experiences earlier, in 2012 when I started this
industry with agile methodology, I have prepared excellent material for agile methodology,
and the agile methodology is one selling point to 40 thought because of agile so many
students joined in 40 thought, some of the students who learnt agile from me, they started
teaching other institutes, and they are using my material, but they are telling to same thing to me,
this are only material worth knowing, you are taught,
so I do not know, I see, I am okay with that, but still, see RPA or DevOps are any automation
to continuously evolve once in a while, it is not a static topic, any automation tool.
