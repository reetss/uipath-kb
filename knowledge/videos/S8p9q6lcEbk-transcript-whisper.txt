Thank you, everyone, for joining. Today, I'm excited to be holding this chat with Kevin
Muni of UI Path and talking about RPA and Cybersecurity. My name is Ahmed Zadi. I'm your host
today. I'm the Chief Automation Officer and CEO here at Accelerate. We are a Diamond
Partner of UI Path. We've been partners with UI Path. Kevin, I don't know if you know it yet,
but you might not have joined. 2017 is when we partnered with UI Path when you're a first
partner manager, a US partner manager arrived and you hired three people in the US. We've
both grown since then. It's been a very fruitful partnership. We really appreciate it. Kevin,
if you want to introduce yourself to the audience. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Ahmed.
So, my name is Kevin Muni. You're right. You predate me at UI Path by just a little bit,
so I've been with UI Path around three and a half years, focusing on security.
And I'm the global security compliance lead for UI Path. It essentially means that I handle all
of these security questions, concerns for all of our customers and partners across all of our
product areas and around the globe. Perfect. So, look, from the audience, if you made it to this
thing today, I am very, very, very certain that you already know what RPA is and you want to hear
about what the security concerns might be. But for those three people who might not have heard about
what RPA is so far, the RPA automation is software that makes it easy to build deploy managed robots
emulate human actions. They interact with various systems and it's a platform for process automation.
I know this might look like a trivial thing, but if you've ever used it and it's
a UI Path product and makes it look easy, but it's a lot of moving parts underneath.
Interestingly, software emulating humans is not new. It's been done before, this type of test
automation and even in 32, 70 emulators, that type of automation has been around. What's different
this time around with RPA is that it's managed and it's enterprise scaled centrally managed and
governed. So, the beauty with robots is not only can they mimic human actions like clicking and
seeing what's on screen, but it's software so it can also access interfaces to applications and
systems that humans might not be able to, for example, APIs and other forms of SDKs and web service
calls and things like that that humans may not be able to do. But that's in a nutshell, RPA,
if you're really interested, if you don't know what it is, go to uipath.com, go to our website,
and there's tons of material on what it is and how it works. But I think one of the big things
that we've been seeing with folks who've been adopting RPA, especially those in the IT space
who it's being introduced to, I think it's very common for them to compare to usual applications
and automation application platforms. But I think what we feel is showing the architecture of the
system opens it up to the discussion of what the various components of a RPA platform are
and where data sits on and so forth. So, what you're seeing on the screen right now is a
on-prem implementation of RPA platform. This is Uipath specific, so on the in the middle you see
Uipath server components, on the right middle and the right hand side, these are all server components
for various parts of the platform, which manages on the left hand side you see here in green,
these are robots. What's interestingly unique about RPA platforms and it's going to change soon,
but is that all execution of processes happens on these agent machines. Now these agent
machines are generally running the same OS as end users except that they're virtual virtualized
either in the cloud or in a virtual platform internally to the to the organization of something like
a VMware or Citrix virtualization platform. So, that's slightly different than when people think about
the actual execution of work which happens on a server. This maybe you can liken this to distributed
computing however there's these agents that work on various on machines that are managed and
communicate their status back to the server component. That's really kind of a uniqueness within
the RPA paradigm that I feel is fairly different from the traditional app dev architecture that you
may be used to. You open up a port from a server to go out to do some to another application, you make
a route from one server to another to to call an API or to you give it access to various file shares
to be able to do something. There's this layer of agent that sits in between the server components of
the platform and the applications that you may already have internally. So, I feel that it's important
for people to understand what the what the architectures look like and this is the same thing in the
cloud. Again, one of the interesting things in Kevin I'd love for your opinion on it. I talk to folks
a lot and they go, hey I have bought the cloud. I don't need any in-house infrastructure or
security reviews or architecture reviews for any in-house architecture and infrastructure and then
we have to tell them yes there are these agents that do sit internally. There are of course even if
you're in the cloud the execution happens on a machine. You've bought a manager. That infrastructure
still needs to be provisioned now. You have had does provide a cloud service where they would be
able to provide you these these VMs but it's that's something to be thought of. Kevin have you seen
have you seen a lot of folks struggle with having to provision internal infrastructure even though
they bought some cloud platforms? Yeah, I mean certainly you know we we often think about it like
you're you're hiring a digital worker when you're you know deploying a robot and just like hiring an
actual worker you have to provision in a machine. You want to put some controls around it and you know
put some bounds on what they're actually doing and connect it into your IT systems. I don't hire
anybody and just say well here's a laptop. Go at it. Good luck. You know that same is true here
for robots and you know we we are seeing it's interesting you mentioned you know UI path is this
starting to come out with a service where we can you know provision the VM for you we can run the robot
essentially for you and what we're seeing more and more of is sort of this hybrid approach for customers
because they they want some things automated within their network and then they also have
automations that you know we're we're all using SAS so if it's only connecting to these SAS
platforms why not put the robot itself is a SAS platform so. Perfect. So Kevin I you know I don't know
if you've ever sat on in one of my one of my pitches or one of my conversations with with folks
that's exactly I mean it's it's it's really interesting I think and it hits home very quickly
I think it'll be it'll be helpful for everyone else as well that that analogy of hiring a worker
any RP vendor what they're selling you is a digital worker right and that's a just a worker now
you have licenses to or whatever model you use you have licensed X number of workers
just like any human worker you were higher your temp agency might say or your your the the recruiter
that finds you might say hey I also have offices and I can also give you machines if you would like
me to right but that doesn't mean that you all your software will run in somebody else's network so
if you start thinking about it in those terms of I'm hiring a worker and I need to give them the
machines and I need to give them the credentials and I need to give them the applications and I need
to treat it very much so like like workers it becomes a much easier thing to understand throughout the
organization I think which is which is really interesting and I'll talk about talk about interesting
ways people approach that one of the other things that as you saw the architecture I think it's important
to understand what components and what data is where this is really important and again our
purpose today was to make sure that everybody understands what these components are where the data is
and different organizations different industries will have different requirements for what can happen
to data and what types of what types of security needs to apply to what things so the three big
portions of it and there this is by no means an exhaustive list of every single product and
component that that UI path has but the three main ones that you always talk about is the studio whether
it be the studio that the developer uses to develop an automation or the studio x component which
the citizen developer uses to develop their automation as a studio it's a development environment it's
an IDE for those in those in IT to understand what IDs are but basically it's the place where you go
in and you develop your automation, configure it basically a sequence of actions and give it the
parameters that it needs in order to branch out and so on and so forth so that's where the development
IDE comes in usually in a the development IDE sits on a machine that the developer uses
usually they use test versions of applications underneath and the code that they generate
is generally integrated with some source code version control system and I say this
is generally because you can do it without but just like you wouldn't write code without actually
doing source code control we would highly recommend that you don't try to write automations without
doing source code control however UI path actually has it built into their platform so even if you didn't
want to do it you automatically will get some level of source code control through environments and
their version control that the UI path does so that's your UI path studio and it also has test logs which
is when the robots run they log everything that they do I am opening this application I have gotten to
this part in the application I'm entering this data in this field and developers love to log these
things so they can test and say okay they got the right places and they got the right data so on and so
forth they're all local test logs that remain on the local machine. The orchestrator is your server
component to go back to the analogy of human workers this is sort of the manager a manager that
doesn't necessarily do the work it manages all the workers but it doesn't do the work so it can
sit outside your network you can sit inside your network and so you can be on the cloud or inside
because it doesn't do any work it doesn't need access to any of their applications it doesn't need
access to any of your data it doesn't need access to pretty much anything other than the workers
that's it the only thing that it needs to communicate with is the workers hence it needs to communicate
with the robots and the network routes that need to open are to the network to the to the robots
what's in the orchestrator because it's a manager it has the credentials the robots talk to the
orchestrator continuously and say I am here and I'm sitting on this machine I'm simplifying it and Kevin
might be like oh there are different models on that so don't hold me to it but the general the general
deployment model is I am a robot I'm sitting here I'm on this machine and I'm a lot that's all it's
telling the orchestrator all the time it just says there's a heartbeat that says I'm alive I'm ready
and what I'm what I'm doing I'm either idle or I'm doing something or there's something wrong with me
or I'm not even available so that's what the orchestrator does every the orchestrator is the one
that actually decides what needs to run where so you create a schedule or you have a trigger whatever
that that initial trigger would be either time-based or event-based trigger the orchestrated decides
that this a particular process needs to be run based on certain rules a particular robot and says
robot xyz I want you to run this and here so the robot says I give me the credentials to log
into the machine it logs into the machine it knows what it has to run so that sort of I'm simplifying
it and we can go into technical details with that but that's pretty much how it happens internally
so the login credentials for the robot sit in the orchestrator and you have the ability to
retrieve it from a IAM system cyber arc integrations built in and Kevin to talk about other
integrations as well the other thing that the orchestrator gets is logs it's no different than any other
log that any other developer writes when the developer says I am doing something you can very specifically
log a a set of a text and that text could be anything when that happens that log also goes to
orchestrated now there's ways to control what level of logs you want to go in there you might say hey
only give me errors and fatals don't give me debug and trace information over both stuff or info
debug craze so you have the ability to bifurcate based on the level what information what level of messages
you want to go to the orchestrator versus some other logging mechanism yeah it should
us measure you know because this gets brought up all the time for us is well you know my my robot
is is working on my most sense of application right we're dealing with finance I want to know what it
does I want to be able to audit it but I don't want numbers exposed to some IT person running my
orchestrator and we actually provide a mechanism for that so you can actually take any log statement
and say you know I want to log the event but I don't want to log the data even if I'm troubleshooting
I've got for post logs running you know I I want to be able to audit it but I don't want to have an
audit problem by having sensitive data in the wrong place we provide that mechanism too absolutely
and it's pretty cool you can you can mark variables as private they don't go anywhere it's actually
pretty cool the way it's done so thank you so much Kevin that's that's absolutely very very helpful
and then so that's the other data that's in the orchestrator assets are think of them as configuration
items these are you know where's the how many times should I retry something or what is the path where
I'd find a file or what is the you know what is the email address that I should send a particular
notification to so on and so forth so assets those are assets and assets can be either numbers text
Boolean the interesting type another interesting type of asset is a credential asset which is I need
to log in to my underlying let's say loan origination system just like I remember think of it as a
as a worker they need to get an asset they need to get a credential to log into the applications
that they need to go into that's also within within the assets but they're stored in the database
encrypted and can be retrieved from cyber arc or any other I am Kevin you want to talk a little bit
about the the asset security and UI path sure yeah and you know so UI path is taking a pretty strong
approach around data security right all of our encryption throughout all of our products if it's
encrypted at rest it's encrypted using a yes 256 that's just period that's our default for everything
and we want to take the best in standard you know we it's good you mentioned cyber arc I really like
cyber arc I actually talked to their team yesterday but not every company uses cyber arc we understand
that and so you know the module within orchestrator that integrates with cyber arc is actually completely
customizable so we offer cyber arc and Azure key vault out the box for for what we support but there
are other vendors out there like psychotic beyond trust and hashi core all of which you can have
integration between orchestrator and those platforms as well and you will find that a bunch of
those are are also on our near term roadmap and you're going to see supported directly by UI path
pretty soon as well perfect and and by the way we've we've done integration with all the
ones that you mentioned Kevin very easily doable yeah the next item that's on the on the list is
two in action items so when work needs to be distributed usually there's a robot that says oh now I
see a file here that file has let's say 5,000 rows and all these 5,000 rows represent 5,000 transactions
that need to be input into another system within the next 30 minutes right that means one worker
isn't enough to be able to input all these transactions into the into the system I need 10
the way you distribute that is to take each one of those transactions and actually put them on a
queue on queue and then tell 5, 10 robots that go get the next item from the queue and process the
transaction and that's the queue queue a portion of the of the data so you can distribute anything that
you'd like so I've had customers who who who wanted some encryption on it we did actually we'd
just put encrypted data on there and then each robot knows to decrypt it using the key that they have
right but you can decide what you want to put in that queue item we've done things like you can just
put the transaction ID and all of that on there the whole transaction on there or you could
obfuscate it or you could then you could actually abstract it and have it somewhere else and just put
a key on on the on the queue item so those are their ways to make sure that what data goes in there
but generally speaking that data is plain text on the database within the orchestrator the developers
the one who decides what data you want to put on the queue in order for the transaction to be able to be
done the other thing the other two big things that are on the orchestrator are what I call the process
execution instructions you would you would liken them to your job age or the document that contains
how you process an invoice for instance right that's it's the same security level as that right it's
it's basically you go into this system you click these buttons you go into that system you click those
buttons you validate this to that and that's that's your code that is the process execution instruction
it is in the form of a package which is which is sort of you know which is zipped up a bunch of files
that represent the code that that the robots understand to execute no data is included here
the unless somebody very silly thing to do but you know it's it's pretty much code right you never
never have any data in the code you never have any any very specific data instructions in the code right
the job schedules and triggers also live on the uipath orchestrator which is when to run a job
where to run the job and what the triggers are to run the job so if you think about the server
component of it and we get a lot of questions about it because of the cloud right oh I'm on the
cloud is all my data exposed is all my all my applications exposed to the to the to the vendors cloud
the answer is no not really right the there's only a few things there and even when they're they are
there it's fairly fairly secure the last thing is the robot machine itself which is the runtime
environment what's on there the the uipath robot gets the code which is the process code the uipath
orchestrator pushes that code to the robot and it has a also has a local history and log of what
it was doing those are the two things and this is on a machine that has all the all the applications
so I know I went through a lot of this but I think it was important because a lot of times folks don't
have an understanding of these three major components of the of the of the of the of RPA platforms
which leads to difficult conversations so having said that I'll remind everyone if you have any
questions feel free to ask in the Q&A session we have quite a few participants here so I'm sure
there are questions coming soon of course there are and number of security risks out there that
people worry about today fishing in DDOS and all sorts of Kevin knows more of them than I do
I don't do this for a living but as being Kevin we're we're talking about this we think that these are
the most common ones that come up in conversation with CISOs and and IT folks under RPA are sort of
these concerns right one data breach data going out somewhere right that's number one
the malware ransomware injection and the unauthorized system access are sort of interrelated
something somehow gets into my network either injects it through one of the robot machines or somehow
gets access to a system and does something a fair use with that system and the fourth one is kind
of interesting it's you know these RPA platforms are also used as citizen development programs so one
of the big things that that folks are worried about are shadow IT so Kevin you want to give some color
on these things and I love a lot is because most of them all stem from sort of a single point which is
I have this software it's doing great things but I don't feel I have the visibility into it that I
should right or I don't know what it's doing and what I find fascinating a lot of times when I talk
to security professionals about this is there's this assumption that I have an understanding of what all
my users are doing first off right and that somehow I'm gonna have less visibility for robots I think all
these kind of go along that theme but you know for data breaches look a lot of these are just the scary
things that keeps us off at night right where is my data how am I preventing it from going out
how am I managing secrets to make sure that we can get a hold of it to get access to my data right
when we're talking about automation and the ability to to do nearly anything with a robot then
it gets sort of concerning where secrets may be stored or where data is being stored right
because part of RPA is actually being able to empower regular users business users who are not
necessarily developers are trained to write code to automate part of their job make their job
easier so one of those concerns is well you know they may stick data in some place they should
and we can get into that a little bit more I I generally find that you know if I do a task a
thousand times as part of my regular job in any year then I pretty well know where I'm supposed to stick
things or where I'm not what I don't necessarily know is well how the platform works and that's kind
of sort of where we get IT involved and sort of make sure that we we understand the guardrails right
I think ransomware malware injection is on everybody's mind
it we see it in the news all the time someone got hit by a ransomware breach they they
intake proper precautions now they're locked down and they're they're facing a you know
payment to some shadow we figure off in a country that you know we're not aware of right
you know this is for RPA really it's not any bigger of a concern than
other IT systems but it's there right and and it's a big scary thing that we hear about a lot
in the news and so we we do want to talk about it and really this comes down to robots are going to
be accessing things potentially without human involvement so if we don't put safeguards around how
they pick up files or say access emails or websites or these sort of things then we have a concern
that there's no human checking that that file now I say that knowing full well a robot can spot a
fishing email a lot better than I can right you know I may not recognize an email with it's from
uipath with two keys dot com right but a robot would so you know there are things to take into account
there and of course unauthorized system access is is a big one because when we start talking about
automation there's always a concern in identity architecture that I could potentially give somebody
more access than they have inherently by giving them the ability to run something right run some
piece of IT right so and this comes up a lot with developers as well where we have to have developers
work alongside the actual business user and owner you you talked about developers working off of test
applications right makes a lot of sense because if I'm automating something in my finance department my
HR department you know I don't want the developer to go and pull down everybody's salary information or
you know what what our company bank account info is looks like so you know there is a risk there
that we have to manage and lastly shadow IT I think we we kind of talked about this already but
this gets brought up to me all the time and it I think it really stems from the the numerous
RPA or automation like vendors and applications they're out there now you know when I interview
people a lot of times they they will tell me oh yeah if you smart P.A. it was a it's a browser-based
extension that I just installed and ran and you know pulled some things from from Twitter for me or
sales force and I was like and that you know when you hear that you hear that being called RPA right
for automation or you hear about some of these applications that get thrown in for free you know
that do RPA you do kind of have a risk of shadow IT here yeah you you have a concern that my users
are going off they're building something I don't know what it looks like I don't know what it does I
may not even know you know what the program they're using is and so as an IT department that that
affects the stability of my environment my end machines and as a as a SISO I look at this and go well I
no longer know what's installed on the user's machine where data is flowing in and out what visibility
I have into the programs they're running there's a lot of potential concerns there so it it is a
risk especially for if you're not looking at an enterprise RPA platform that your users can can
end up creating workflows that you don't know what's going on and you no longer have a clear distinction
of what IT systems are connecting dollars so yeah absolutely a couple of things and I like to give
you know in our webinars just pointed very pragmatic advice to all our listeners right so I as you
were talking I was going through in my head I'm like oh all right there are these four things and
people are going to ask these questions so the how how at least from our perspective and UI path
having done multiple implementations the things that that put these concerns to sort of ease
again remember when people talk about data breach right the machines that that data is on
are no different than the machines that you have people working on hence it's not you're not adding
to the surface area of attack right it's the same thing it's the same type of machine
as long as you put the same controls that you put on humans on those machines you're just at least
just as safe as humans right so so the data breach is not as big a deal because you can control
what goes on the server side and and usually the servers are residing in the same sort of data centers
and under the same security regime as as the rest of your environment so if somebody gets that far in
I don't think the orchestrator server is the one that you need to worry about being breached all right
it's there's multiple layers even if the server's breached to actually be able to get to anything
of use other than the logs which you can control right again it also goes so data breaches are
are you know in my opinion from us I look at it from a have I just increased the surface area
by default by adding another server you have but it's no different than adding any other
application it's not like you're you know even in the cloud and you know you're you're in a sure
if you're if you're if you're using Office 365 you're already out in the cloud and it's you know
if somebody has blessed that and so it's again from a surface area perspective I don't think you're
increasing it that much what do you think Kevin no I I think it's a great point um it and it
speaks to something I hear all the time which you know now that I have this robot it's it's almost
seems to users who are who haven't dealt with RPA a lot that you know installing this is it's
going to be standalone and it's going to be separate from all my IT trolls when you hit it on the
head when really all my endpoint protection that I've already included all my EDRs all my you know
anti malware at all the global policy controls that I put in place for user well they apply for
these robots working too um you know that's that's actually one of the good things is our software works
just like a user on a machine allows us to integrate a lot more also allows us to take advantage
of all of the security and policy that you've already put in place on the on the other two things one
of the interesting things that you know I read all these things in Kevin you're you're security guys
I'm sure you know more data about this database evidence on this than I do but from what I always
hear malware and ransomware most times is injected into the into the into an organization because
somebody somewhere clicked on something right yeah some person clicked on it laying some person got an
email some person went to a website in an enterprise I think it's it's it is much much much much much
more likely that a human causes that type of stuff and a robot does because my robot inbox could get
all the emails in the world about uh about an account in Wells Fargo that has an overground
something right but if it's not from the right email address with the right text in the right format
with a specific set of rules that it's trying to do by the way it's not designed to click on links it says
when an email comes from here go to the Wells Fargo website and then go there's an even so the risks
are extremely low and in fact um you know robots don't write down their passwords under the desk
and or on the on a sticky note and paste it over there or write it and explain text file and say here
all my logins for all the all the state websites that I need to go there to do to file the tax returns
and so on and so forth um you know those credentials are extremely extremely extremely um guarded if you
may either through integration through the third party iam or just the pure uh encryption
behind layers and layers of firewalls uh in the in the in the in the in the data store of the actual
of orchestrator so I think malware ads were injection you kind of safe and you can say again these
these are these are practical things that we talk about unauthorized system access that's interesting
there is a full set of permissioning that goes along with who has access to what
within within the within these platforms I think the bottom two I will say
are pretty interesting I think as you know when we started we talked about the the macros and access
you know um sort of the the the automations that were built into 32 to 70 emulators for
instance succeed hummingbird at this beautiful thing I used to use it all the time yeah you know
go fill out my uh test data in my mainframe application that I will have to put in my first job was
a test engineer and I had to put in you know 200 test cases every day into my systems I made
little automation to do it but either way the problem with all of those things were those are
unmanaged right we I come from capital markets we we had uh excel macros galore everybody in finance
is probably pulling out the hair like oh my every one of my guys has a has a macro the problem with
those macros is you don't know when they run you don't know what's inside it until you get to the
machine and actually open up the code and take a look at it you don't know what it does um these three
four things I think RPA RPA's adoption and the enterprise was really due to the governance the
central governance that the orchestrator or the platform brought to automation right it is it is
that one central place where you can go and say who has access to what you can see what's being run
when it's being run where it's being run what is being accessed and actually there's a lot of granular
control that you can put to to de-risk yourself from having that shadow IT um it's been done you
and we we didn't touch on it too much but you know if you look into the way orchestrators actually
managed the way the the role-based access controls and the sort of organizational structures
are set up it mimics a very familiar paradigm and that's an active director um or any LDAP for that
matter you know we have it's multi-tenant we have folders that function exactly like organizational
units this is a paradigm that's been around for a long time uh and we we modeled it because it made a
lot of sense to us and if I look back at UI path um you know seven years ago right uh we were selling
sort of studio initially getting RPA off the ground and then you know we started to have customers who
were yelling at us once they got going um and it's because their their IT teams came along and said
what are you doing right more than exactly you know and we we look at it and said okay what are all
of the pieces that an IT team needs to mimic what they're already doing integrate into their enterprise
IT integrate into all the checks and balances their change management their controls their policies
to make this successful and now we we actually preach with our account managers with our CSM's to say
you know with our partner teams that the first thing you do is you get your your proof of concept rolling
and then you go talk to IT to say well how do we design this for for you to be successful yeah
good good segue into the next thing and and and Smitha I have your question here uh of uh workflow
visibility definitely we'll get to it when we get to get to question answers hang on just just a few
minutes um the answers yes the short answer uh but if we look at uh some of the mitigations right I think
I think we've talked about quite a few things and Kevin you that was that was a good segue
because I think that conversation after the POC you guys are on the vendor side so you do that
POC you've already convinced the customer then they contact us and say hey we just we just got we just
got UI path right Ken can we just get going and to be very honest I think what we do and that's this
is really really important to do upfront which have seen programs not be successful when this is not
done so establish a governance framework I put that up front but I what I what I mean by that is
at least know what you're going to do and the best way to do that is to get at this point it's easier
to get people in the market who have already done it before right five years ago it was difficult
to find somebody who knows how a governance good governance framework for our PA right there was only
a few people out there who had done this but now you talk to your partner vendor whoever that is
Kevin can can point you to resources within UI path will give you a good operating model and all
of that they have the AOM right but establish a quickly establish a governance framework that says
how are going to eventually going to be happening how is and to be very honest I'll tell you guys
if you haven't done it yet it's not a long exercise it can be done very quickly if you
most of the things that you need to establish the governance framework are ready in your organization
you just need to repurpose them and say we do this for this and document it so that when the
audit comes you actually have something to show them that says because you're doing them now you
this is how we credential our bots this is how we request a review of something this is how we have
we request robot credentials for applications that are not AD SSL right whatever that is so
so for us Kevin once you're done with the POC before we start our engagement especially on new
implementations are there two meetings that we have one is with the IT infrastructure folks to
actually go through the infrastructure the second one is security and compliance right the slides I
actually gave you are out of that slide deck that we go through the first slide that are out of that
security and compliance slide deck we we go through here are the different components what are your
concerns and both in terms of IT security as well as compliance and audit right how long do you want
to keep the logs what type of data do you want to keep the logs from a from a security perspective what
zone should these components go in once it's different the answer is always different it's not like
one size fits all for everyone right as Kevin said you have a SaaS application that's publicly
available don't need to be on the VPN for it and you need to do it all the time you could have a
dummy machine out in Azure and just run your things right but you have an internal application that
does you know compensation and or bank statements for your transactions for your business you probably
need something inside your network and or something that deals with PII or or you know medical data that
needs to be hippocomplied things like that the the the important thing is having that security review
and the last one is talk to your RP vendor and you know I'll have Kevin rat love some of the some
of the some of the verifications that they have then some of the certifications that they have
varicode and ISO and so on and so forth but I think that's also very important Kevin your thoughts on
these mitigations yeah so I like to hear that you know where the first things you do is go talk to the
IT department talk to the security I I think it's really important and I think establishing governance
is is right up there too many times we see customers come in and say well we're buying software we're
going to take it in oh we got to develop a whole new process for for how we deal with this right and
you're exactly right is typically you know especially established organizations or enterprise
customers they already have something in place for well how do I you know write a standard
offering procedure you know get it approved who actually runs it what you know what permissions to
those people need who who's doing oversight of those automation really isn't all that different
than writing an SOP it's just potentially being executed by a robot instead of a user and that
doesn't mean you have to fully hand it over to a robot either you know a lot of times we get into
sort of a hybrid automation where a user starts something they kick off a robot and then another
user comes back and checks and verifies things and sending these things up front are all great because
then I can tell my developers hey meet these process you know check marks right make sure you you go
through a scanner of the workflow you include logs statements for these sort of activities so that we
we can audit it later you know if you're hitting these systems or dealing with this data do it on
these machines we will set something up separate for you and once you sort of set those guidelines
your users your developers can go full speed and they can start getting you that ROI and back and
I like the compliance and audit review I I have talked to probably
easily a thousand of our customers about security and whenever I get into a customer that deals with
a regulated industry whether that be finance or healthcare or government or even just a public
company where they have to do reporting you know they have Sarbanes Oxley they're always worried about
this idea of audit how do I audit a robot and at every single time I tell them well go run an automation
and go through a mock audit and invariably the first time they do it they come back and they say
I have so much data on what my robots did when and under what user and you know I can follow it all
and it's all right there my socks audit got a thousand times easier and it's like you have more
visibility because the robot you know tells you every time it starts a process as opposed to a user who
you know we forget sometimes I know I do imagine somebody having to pick up a notebook every time
they're doing it and say I am just logging in oh right then I just did this and I did this and I did
this and I'm done exactly which is what the robot does the robot literally does just that I am looking at
this I'm going to be doing this and this is when I started this is what I ended and by the way
here is an exact audit of all the decisions that I took and why
yeah absolutely and yeah so validating your RPA vendor you know UIPath we like to be humble as we
say so we'll try and brag about ourselves too much that being said security is very very important to
us we understand that you know regulated industries are going to use our software major enterprise
customers are going to be using our software and even your your mom and pop shop you know this could
be vital to them we want to make sure that our software is secure out of the box and not only that
that we give you all of the options to connect our software into your security stack into your IT stack
so you can take advantage of all the good practices that you already haven't played so
yeah our our cloud you know we've gone through sock two type two we we just really start our first
hip out of stations you know we're working on FedRAMP at the moment and you'll see on a six-month
cycle we'll just be putting out new certifications new audit reports and these will just keep coming
we're very committed to it you know we as a company probably release a major feature or a
product every two months now which is a massive growth cycle but that's also why we have a six-month
audit cycle now where you'll see a lot of other vendors they go full year or maybe they don't maybe
they just have you know a certification that's static and we we do six months so we can add those
new services every single time and keep expanding our scope and so you know I will talk about every
certification thing we have in there but have to answer any questions around our our security
security software development life cycle at our audit program perfect thank you so much Kevin I
really enjoyed our conversation today folks are our email addresses are right there if you have any
additional questions feel free to ask it now or feel free to send out an email to either one of us
you can you can find us wherever you found this the registration link for this webinar
