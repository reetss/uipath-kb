I am not going to cover any parts of RPA basic things but I will start with what is an
RPA lifecycle and stuff like that okay.
The other things I think we have already discussed much in the introduction so I am not
going to go with the basic introduction of what is RPA and what are the use cases and
stuff like that.
I am just going to start with the RPA lifecycle.
So what is the lifecycle?
The lifecycle is going to be when you require to implement a particular, but as a process automation
right.
So when I say a process automation what could be fitting under a process automation is
what we need to first understand right.
Not every project might fit under it will have its own reasons and it will have its
own you know feasibility is that it may be developed into an automation project or it
may not be into an automation project right.
So if you say so that is what we have in we discuss and we do all these things in our
discovery phase.
So when you get an idea of what you are going to do or when you get an idea of your requirement
then we are going to go ahead and start with the requirement understand the requirement
and go ahead with to see what is the feasibility of the solution that we can do it as a process
automation.
So most of the things that we are talking about is an existing process that is already
in place which is executed by humans right.
So we are going to make that only into a process automation.
So it could be a business process.
It could be just a part of the process or it could be any kind of you know a detailed
process which is which is going to be like they might be you know a kind of process which
might be linking between several systems or several domains like not domain several streams
of your thing.
So it could be you know you know linking with sales it could be from there we might take
it for the marketing from there we might take it for another set of customer demand data
so all those things we might be doing into one single process or you could you know I
follow the same process that is manually done and we could do the automation.
So who are the people involved here we have the client or your subject matter expert
who will be your product owner right.
So that particular product owner or the process owner so that particular person is going
to talk about all the existing ways that they are doing this automation.
Then you have if the process owner is not available then we might have a business analyst
who is there.
Okay.
A business analyst who is more of a techno functional role and who would go hide and understand
the requirement and then transpose that particular requirement into a technical aspect
to the technical team and then we have an architect or whoever is your senior lead right.
So these three people will be the ones who will be discussing where the architect or the
technical people will be understanding the requirement and understanding the feasibility.
So even before this there is something called an opportunity assessment if the requirement
is not coming from the customer then you are going to talk about an opportunity assessment
where you go and see if there is an opportunity for automation in any of the projects but
if the requirement is coming from the customer then there is no an opportunity assessment.
Right.
Right.
So what happens in the feasibility?
So what happens in your discovery state.
So you see whether it is a feasible solution whether a feasibility analysis will be done
whether the solution is feasible what kind of automation are we going to do whether it
is an unattended or an unattended automation what is the complexity of the automation we
have a scale of high very high medium high medium then you have low and low medium something
like that I think there was there is one more thing which will be this is pertaining to
your company where you work.
Okay.
Then we do a dependency as to what are the other dependent systems that we are going to
touch base or where the data will be going or where we are going to send our output or
send our employment give receiver inputs and stuff like that then we have the usability
analysis usability analysis is again a place where you understand what what is the outcome
of my process automation how many people are going to use it or how many hours am I going
to say or how we are going to talk about both tangible as well as intangible figures right.
So we talk all this in your we we understand all this as once we feel okay this is a feasible
solution that we can do it as a process automation then we are going to create a process design
document or a process definition document which is a PDD and you capture everything.
So here we are going to capture everything in the form of either you for you capture it
in the form of functional wordings or you for you capture it in the form of a process map
right then we get into the automate stage.
So in the discovery phase itself you will have estimations and everything so usually there
will be a 30% or a 20% because a process automation is something that we are working on an
existing system.
So there is always a chance that the existing system may not be completely in sync working
with the tool that we are working right whether it is UI path or any other automation
tool.
So we always give for any project we always give for 20% buffer so that we see all the
scenarios are working or things like that so the estimations will be calculated in that
way.
So the recommended is 10 to 15% depending on the companies and depending on whichever project
you are the complexity of the project you are the buffer percentage increases.
So all this is done and then we are getting into the automate state where we are actually
going for the development where the budget the allocation of the resources what is the
tool and then we have a solution document all those things are going to be configured and
we are going to have something called a solution design document okay.
So who is going to be involved the actually this is the place where you are going to talk
about a source management system or a source control system also which means your product
or your process is first time going to be created in a UI path studio.
So who will create it your architect or your technical lead will be creating it in your
SVN or in your GitHub or in your TFS and then access will be given to you guys or given
to the developers.
And then we will start with the working and who is going to work on what what is the
number of hours that we are working these are all kind of you know the project management
will be tracking but otherwise is a developer some some people who are in a senior role
right anybody is who are in the senior developer roles will be able to track this information
as well.
And then once your development process starts so you are going to always have a as
a solution which is the current human operated solution and to be proposed solution which
should be the process automation that we do it with a tool right with a bot.
So you do all those things and once your product is almost you have done with your you
know individual files or individual you know team has been working.
So then you come with your optimized state your optimized state is where you actually integrate
your workflow.
So when you integrate who is having a problem or which file is having input related
issues then you do a lot of the bugs then you do a lot of exception handling all those
things will be done and finally you will have an integrated workflow right one single
project.
So every time in this automated state if you are if you are practicing an automated state
of two months you might be actually having a lot of time also available for the integrated
workflow.
So somebody will be integrating the code and the basic operation of the source control
system where you do a check in check out every day and your code is automatically updated
into the source control system and then we go into the automated state where you integrate
the workflow we do the unit testing and that's when the quality team will be coming into
the picture to go out to create your test cases and then we are going into our monitor state
where in our monitor status where we are going to show case R product to the customer or
to the process owner.
So this is when along with the UIT we capture all the users recommendations there might be
a lot of you know information that the user might be saying no this was not this is expected
or we wanted you know you can do an add on to this particular feature.
So all those things will be coming so if there is a new requirement then we call it as
a new scope right so we have it as a change management.
So that comes into the picture and the UIT keeps happening while the developer also creates
all the you know in case there are additional changes then the developer will be additionally
modifying their code to you know withhold that particular changes and then we are going
to also have in case you are having issues with the in the testing then you will talk about
the effect management.
So the defects gets fixed it goes back to the developer and the tester to and for multiple
rounds of testing will be done and the most important state is your monitor state where
you are actually testing the product and you are showing it to the process owner so that
everything is ready and is visible into the hands of the process owner or your customer
right.
And then once everything is done we calculate a lot of metrics and we plan for the goal
I.
So goal I was going to be what is a number of issues that are the number of efforts that
we have planned the metrics is going to be your effort variance, your schedule variance
and all the stuff that will be coming what was the defect analysis we did how many defects
was it coming.
So as per you know as per your company's thing you might be agreed for a 10% sorry defects.
So in case you have more number of defects so what is the defects ratio all those things
will be coming into the picture okay.
So where are we in line with the basic figures that we actually have your company might be
having a figure of say 10% of defects but you might be touching in this particular project
if it touches to a 15% of defects and you will talk about your project is not the right
project okay somewhere you have to correct a lot of steps so that for the next project
we do not have a similar situation right.
We do a lot of metrics analysis and they will be reporting most of the metrics will go
you know in terms of efforts and everything might not go but some you know metrics which
in terms of defects and things like that might also go to the customer it is not a mandatory
step it is between the relationship that the company has along with the customer based
on that you get your information passed on right whatever is the information that needs
to be passed on it goes on and then we plan for a goal I was nothing but on to the customer's
mission.
So usually most of the time we might not be dealing with individual missions of the user
so we might give them the one server which is the orchestrator installation and we might
just install it there and from there most of the companies from there if we give the document
or we give a deployment guide they take it from there to the because they might be having
when you are running a process automation for a particular customer they might be having
somebody from their side who is aware of the automation okay most of the companies now has
an automation person who is aware of how to run process how to actually you know if there
is a process having a problem or how to deploy it on multiple missions and things like
that multiple end users okay so most of the time especially when you are talking about
any unattended thing you are going to talk about only orchestrator deployment which is
goes into the company server or the company's mission or something and then we are going
to talk about deployment into the end users mission so the goal I will be planned and
then we have the control state so the control state will be monitoring of your what happens
so far we created the process automation in an environment which was a replica of the
actual production environment right so now we have since we have deployed it into our
actual production data you might be dealing with the actual production data that is coming
in or the actual live data that is actually coming in and then we are going to monitor it
is your process the automation process that you did is it working as in stake with the actual
requirement that we have or is there any issues or is it hanging down anywhere or is the data
getting processed most of the time right so we might be there there might be cases of like you
put it in a face manner or you put it as one shot you might put it as a goal I mean all those
things that that depends on what kind of project you are and stuff like that and then we do all
the metric stacking and finally after your post implementation support or during your post
implementation support even the number of errors that you received during the support that
you are giving for your product even those will be calculated so that only actually defines what
was the intense of your project that you have done as it been working the same way that you know
what was the bettering that you have done what was the sorry what was the betterment you have done
have you increased the execution time or have you decreased the execution time all those things
will be tracked and then you have the post implementation support and your total metrics and
with this we close the project there might be somebody called a bot controller from either from
the customer side or from the you know the from the actual development side who will be monitoring
the thing if the company if the customer requires somebody from the technical team to be available
we have shared resources will be available the the role name might be the bot controller who will be
actually working on multiple processes just controlling the process and monitoring the processes
onto that customer's mission or onto if it is on the you know on the mission that we have access
then they might be accessing that particular mission so this is what we have as an RPA lifecycle
so any RPA tool that you are going to use the same lifecycle will be followed and the same
set of documents will be followed you have an opportunity assessment you have a process design
or a definition document you have a solution design document then you have a PDF which will be the
instruction that says okay this is how I'll be clicking from this page I'll go to this button
I'll go from this button to this this page will open up it is a kind of a navigation walkthrough
okay for any kind of a tool a process design instruction and then you have a software and hardware
requirement as is and the proposed solution a summary report a summary report is the execution report
that your bot has done for a particular execution so suppose if you're doing a data processing
then it will say I did this many data's process this many was an application exception this many
was an a business exception this many data process through this is the final result so all the for
a particular execution if it runs today you have a summary report if it runs tomorrow another
summary report and you have a unit test case and a UID tracker and a deployment guide and finally
a user guide as to if in case it involves and use it and how are we going to do it okay this
will be the overall picture this is going to be very much important when you're going to talk about
you're going for a job interview or you have an interview asking what is your role and stuff
you're going to go ahead and talk about all these things irrespective of whatever is your role
you can talk about your PDD or your SDD this is what you have updated or this is what I have done
so this was the mail automation we had this many issues so we captured it in an
effect management tracker and all those things you will be able to capture and I mean you will be
able to talk about all those things right and then we also okay these are the roles and
responsibilities so who does what right so you have the process owner and the SME or the
business analyst who will be documenting all those things and then the developer will actually
do all those things and then we do our testing and deployment and finally there will be a
testing sign-off and a deployment on the production where the automation solution will be used
by the end users right by now this one you are aware right we have a studio to actually
work on the workflow then we have a bot which is inbuilt which will be executing the workflow
that you have designed and then we have an orchestrator which will actually monitor and deploy the
process in stuff like that right so this is something that we are already aware of
okay then we were talking about what are the available the overview of the UI path studio right
so when I say the overview of this studio it is going to be
yeah so when I say it is an overview of this studio you have a lot of project templates
you have the first the basic flow is going to be a sequence and a flow chat right a sequence is
going to be more linear right one box after another is going to be a sequence suppose you want
to connect or make branching or you want to make decisions and we have something called a flow chat
right so which will have decision making which will have branchable branches okay one second
so we are going to talk about a flow chat which will have multiple branching that will be available
so a flow chat sequence is going to be the smallest form of a project a flow chat will be like you
can do it for even larger projects you will be able to use a flow chat okay so which means you can
go ahead and connect or you can go ahead and see multiple branching that will be available then the
next one is going to be a state mission a state mission uses a concept where flow chat will not
be able to connect to itself a state mission you will be able to connect to the same box again and again
in the state mission we have a concept called state at the final state each state which means
from one box you can jump to any other box that is what is a basic idea of state mission okay so
which means you are going to uncertain conditions this the similar statement as a go to statement
so you might be writing a piece of code and you will say on this particular scenario go to
this particular statement right so the similar thing you can actually using a state mission
so we have on each state okay we have something called an entry exit and a transition so which
means on entry or into that particular box what we are supposed to do when we are moving out of
that particular activity what are we supposed to do and on what condition am I going to move out
of the box that will be coming under the transition so the robotic enterprise framework works on
the state mission so we are going to cover what is state mission when we are doing the robotic
enterprise framework and whenever you want to do error handling so when you want to do an error
handling we are going to talk about the global exception handler so a single project will be
having one global exception global handler okay so global exception handler will be just one
particular file per project so this will be actually this will actually define the project's
behavior that is need to that the project need to behave when it encounters an error so which
means if there is an exception that occurs then you are going to move the particular project the
flow will be moved and going on to the control will go on to the global exception handler from
there it will say okay this particular error you can redrive or you can go ahead so instead of you
writing it in the catch block in the catch block you will be calling the global exception handler okay
from there the control will go on there it will gather or it will describe the project's behavior
and from there it will come back to the project back again to the price section okay so based on
those particular things you can do global handler is going to be one single fight which will
work across all the projects I mean all the all the example files okay then we were talking about
the different project templates one is going to be the basic process template which is the basic
template okay remember all the templates are all the project templates however you define your
project templates everything is going to be deployed in the orchestrator only so everything will
be at one point will be converted to an orchestrator process template okay so always whether you
have it as a trigger based automation or whether you have it as a process it's going to move on to
the orchestrator only at the end of the day right so don't confuse yourself can I have only if it
is an orchestration process template only I need to deploy it an orchestrator if it is a background
process then I will not have it in the orchestrator no it's not like that every project that you
every process automation that you do is going to be in the orchestrator only okay and then we are
going to say the simple process was a simple process automation that you are doing and even if it
is a simple process automation you can drag and drop multiple flowchats multiple sequences multiple
sample files and all those things and you can create a full-fledged bigger complex project also
end of the day that also will go into the orchestrator for deployment right so what is the difference
between each of the project when you're dealing with a very high-level project we will have
you will be designing the or you will be deciding the what is your project template that you'll be
working so all right so anything that you are going to work on you know a very
detailed kind of a framework where you have multiple data processing or the transactions
are going to be there so multiple data processing that you might be doing might fit under the
robotic enterprise framework most of the projects now are into a robotic enterprise framework only
but when we are when you are understanding robotic enterprise framework you will get to know it
better okay most of the data projects are most of the transaction based vases for our projects are
going to be fitting under the robotic enterprise framework and then we have an orchestration process
orchestration process is nothing but the a process which is deployed on the orchestrator so that
it it supports human intervention as well as an unattended automation okay so which is
anything that whether you want it as an user-based operation project or which is an
attended automation or an unattended automation long-term transactions can be deployed as an
orchestration process template you can create a similar process that you are doing with the
basic process template the same thing you can do it in the orchestration process template also
and you can deploy it whether it is unattended or an attended automation then we have something
called a background process a background process is basically going to be an unattended automation
only okay which means it runs at the background so which means you are not going to have any user
interaction okay so when you don't have an user interaction then it is going to be running at the
background whether user might not be aware of so those kind of process only we call it as a
background process so which means you are not going to have any activity which deals with user
interaction no message boxes no error handling has to be perfect so that no error handling is
displayed as a pop-up box to the customer or to the end user so those kind of processes we have
it as a background process and then we have a transactional process a transactional process is
similar to an orchestration process but it is going to have more kind of transactions it will be
based on a flowchart methodology okay even a simple process can be worked as a transactional
process if you click and drag a flowchart inside a process then it is going to become a transactional
process okay this is also a basic automation process that we have right and then we have a trigger
based automation a trigger based automation is something which will be different from the other
project templates right so trigger based automation is nothing but you have a trigger which means it
is going to be an attended automation so it is an attended automation where the user has to have
a interaction with the project or with the process automation so trigger based automation is going
to have certain triggers like you have mouse click you have an application trigger and you have a
non application trigger so let's talk about now that we are aware about user interfaces and everything
so you have any user interface trigger and you have a non user interface trigger okay a user
interface trigger is categorized into you have an application which is open that is your user
interface so anywhere in your application when you are going to have a mouse click or a keyboard
that you press okay anywhere in this particular corner of the application on the top right corner
of the application I go into double clicks so that is a mouse click event on the application so
similarly you have a keyboard event on that particular application okay you have the application
you have the user interface open and you are going to do a keyboard press so at that time you are
going to have the application the trigger happening okay so a certain set of operations will be working
sorry so this is based on the user interface then the next trigger the third trigger that we have
is a general trigger which is not based on the user interface which means if you have a system
opened anywhere you press a control key or a control enter or a shift enter or whatever
keyboard that you actions that you do if you set it there will be a set of events that will be
done so this is an important interview interview question that we ask so what is the what kind
of activities you can perform in a trigger based automation okay so base one will be user interface
based on inside the user interface if you do a mouse action or a keyboard action okay
and outside the user interface so with where you do not have an user interface even if you have
any application open you do that particular operation which is a keyboard event only so you do
that particular operation then at that time your events are going to be triggered or your
corresponding actions are going to be triggered so most of the times you can use a trigger based
automation when you have certain files or when you say okay I am going to run ad hoc processes
when I receive a particular email I am going to trigger a trigger based I can press a keyboard
trigger and I'll say okay run this particular set of automation so that particular bot will be looking
at the email that you got and then it will start so rather than you creating a process automation
which you know you have to start every time anybody who is using that particular system will be
able to start the trigger based automation so these kind of scenarios you go mostly trigger based
automation is not a widely used one the other templates yes most of the time we'll be using the
robotics and apprised framework only so the robot and apprised framework is a template where
you're going to have it is a much easier template which is going to be which is developed or which
is formed to help the developers so just for the ease of working for the developers and so that
you follow a proper methodology of writing your code or writing your flowchart that is why we
have the robotic enterprise framework so the robot enterprise framework will actually list you
okay this is your first set of actions that you need to do after this in your project compulsively
you have to do these set of operations and then the third thing will be another set of compulsively
operations and then you will go for transaction processing and then you will go and end the process
so you will have an order in which you will be executing your code okay so that any order fails
you will be seeing that okay this this particular area we have got a fail so probably this is the
exception that it has occurred so you go and log the exception or you go and you know handle
that particular exception right so this particular framework allows all the best practices for
the developer so which means you're logging mechanisms you're retry mechanisms how do you
actually log into an application how do you actually log out into an application how do you close all
your sessions sometimes you might just be opening and we might not log out itself so you have to
go and log out of the application right so those kind of scenarios you have to manually do
this particular in this particular framework even if there is a chance that you might be missing
in all the things because you do not have a framework design decided right here it will not be the case
you have the framework so there is no chance that you will be missing because the framework will not
work if you don't log out the entire project will not work so you have to go and manage to
rely to your log out functionality okay so that is how you will be actually that is how the framework
is designed we are going to see more in the coming classes so you will be able to understand right
and then we saw what was variables right the basic programming information so whenever you are
going to have data processing or whenever you're going to have information coming and going out
of your program you're going to hold it inside of the box and you're going to use that
only if the name of the box is available you will be able to go and refer the data
if you don't have the box available then the data cannot be referred the data will be lost
this is what we call it as variables variables are the boxes which is going to hold the data right
so we have different kinds of information that we are going to hold you could hold text information
which is if the basic names numbers special characters and all those things you can you can hold
it in a box called string then we have integer which is going to be all the number information
then we have volume which is going to be true of all information then we have array array list
dictionary these are all collection objects array is going to be list of array is going to be
the same set of you know instead of holding just one data you'll have multiple values of the same
data you go inside the library you take 10 books under your name 10 books will be written this is a
concept of value okay so always remember that where you can use an array whenever you have
limited set of data you can go and use the array when you know that you're going to have deal
with only 10 information then you go ahead and deal with areas so suppose you do not know
what is the set of information what is the count of the information that you put to have then you
use the concept of list the difference between array and list again a very important question
in terms of certification and in terms of interviews what is the difference between an array and a
list when you do not know the count of the information or when you need to modify the content of
the information then you're going to have lists right so arrays and list are most are the same
it could be array of string list of integer list of booleans or array of boolean it could be any
kind of information right so when we are dealing with most of the time if you remember in the mail
automation we said list of emails list of mail messages right because we do not know what is a
content of the email or we do not know what we what we will be doing with the mail you might be
modifying the content of the email and things like that there are on those kind of scenarios you're
not going to use arrays so we are going to use a list only okay so anywhere when you when you're
dealing with smaller amount of data you use arrays when you're dealing with bigger amount of data which
needs to be modified or which needs to be worked on then you're going to use list so which means if
you're modifying any physical folders okay then you're going to have list of folders if you're
modifying emails and you're going to have list of mail messages if you're doing any kind of
automation where you're going to capture all the information from multiple excel sheets then you
want to have list of excel sheets right so these are the different information that you will be
capturing in terms of list then we have dictionary dictionary we'll anyway cover dictionary is an
object where you're going to you're going to load pairs of values right and then we have another
information called date and time date and time is simply going to have date and time information
so you can have it in the whatever format that you have whether you want it as a month first date
first date second and the year so you can re-change the order in the way that you require then we
have the data table so data table is going to be when you have bigger pieces of data right so when
you have bigger chance of data and you're going to talk about maru and columns and you have two
dimensional data that is available so anything which is in the format of excel sheet which is in
the format of a table in the webpage which is in the format of a data grid in the webpage which is
in the form of a database table any ms access tables all those things are going to be in the format
of data table so blindly you can just convert that into a data table and you can start processing
your data okay so that will be the data table information then to do the conversions right so always
we have conversions that we need to do so you add a dot two string if you want to convert it into
a string information you add a C in top if you want to convert it into an integer information
then you had a C date of a prefix you had a prefix of C date if you want to convert it into a date
information right so you're going to have C date of the variable name so which means that
particular variable name will be converted into a date format so these kind of conversions also
you can do so you define in the variable panel suppose you define it as a string and you're storing
a date information you can convert this into a date format wherever you need to make comparisons
or wherever you need to make some date functionality operations you can convert at that particular
scenario you can convert it into a C date of and then do the particular operation and then your box
will still be of the string type only you can also do a multiple processing after conversion
once you convert it you can put it into a different variable and store it or you can
use it inside your application or during processing and then you can you know just leave it
so there are scenarios where you might be individually required to convert the convert the
variable types right so these kind of conversions are still explicitly allowed in UI path
but suppose your project involves too much of conversion like you do not know what kind of
information is going to come in so the safety factor what they did was a proprietary variable was
defined which is the generic value variable which is proprietary only to UI path so it cannot be
used elsewhere this is a UI path owned variable type okay so the generic value variable is going
to be something where automatic conversions happen so you can convert from one kind of data to any
any kind of data so even if you store it as a string and you want to do an integer operation you
will be able to do it on that particular automatically okay so that is the generic value and then we
have another proprietary variable which is the q item these two are only the proprietary variables
other variables will if you need to refer Microsoft.net and you can and you are working on some
complex projects which requires.net then you can use the same.net concepts.net variables and you
can go ahead okay but that may not be required but usually the set of variables will be allowed
the final proprietary variable is going to be the q item so the q item variable is going to be used
whenever you are going to use orchestrator q's okay with that we are going to cover when we are
doing orchestrator okay another important certification or an interview question what is the
conversion usually you will have this at least one question in the certification so what will be
the conversion so if you are converting from an integer to a string format then it will do the
addition okay the same thing if you are going to have a string format first double course
followed by a concatenation symbol and a 10 it is going to do a concatenation that is what it does
okay a generic value always you need to make sure what kind of information you are passing based
on the base information only the operation will be performed not only for generic value even in a
message box if you type if you have a string information followed by something it will do the
concatenation operation only so if you want to write something it will ask for sure it will ask the
double course value that needs to be specified okay that is the overall picture of the variables
and stuff like that so the variable panel is something you are already aware by now what we do
in the variable panel you have the variable name the type and the scope where your variable is
going to be used precisely you have to define it based on your project requirement this would be
identified when you are doing the SDD document itself most of the time your variables and your
names and what because you will be following a certain naming convention and all those things
will be defined so these are the number of variables these are the number of exceptions that will be
creating these are the invalid scenarios so everything will be identified in your SDD document
itself and you can just follow that particular information so there you will be identifying until
where this particular variable needs to be available do I need it for the entire login functionality
or for the entire application to be running so everything you will define and then we have a
default field default is the basic field which will have in case you have a default value that
the particular need variable need to hold okay this is our optional field mandatory you are not
supposed to give this particular thing you care for this only we have the option of instead of
you writing in the default only we bring it from outside the project we bring it from the configuration
file okay but it is it is no harm if you are having some counters that you want to do if you are
doing some beta mechanism if you initiate the value with 0 so those kind of information you can
still go and give it in the variable pattern okay that should also work or the ideal way is bring
it from the configuration file most of the variables that you feel that might be changing bring it from
the configuration file okay then we had something called the control flow control flow or the
activities which is going to control the flow of the operation so repetitive actions if you want
to say you want to go ahead and do some equations if you want to assign a particular counter so those
kind of operations only which you control the flow of the operation the execution is called the
control flow activities so you have an assign activity which is going to be assigning certain
information to another information so it could be equations it could be simple numbers or it could
be adding numbers or it could be anything that you want to assign right so you can use an
assigned statement and then you have condition checking which is if and a flow decision if it is
going to be the basic understanding between an if and a flow decision is make sure that you
precisely define here it is going to be visually appealing when you are using a flow decision
both has two choices only if true if false so it is if then else right so similar to a flow
decision also you will be having if sorry a flow decision true and a false but the only point
where we go ahead and use a flow decision is say suppose you are doing in the if section you're
writing a piece of code for the then okay or the else block you're writing a piece of code if in
the else block at the certain step suppose you're writing 10 steps and in the eighth step or in
the tenth step you want to connect back to the box before the if means you won't be able to do
so it is a sequence only which will be written inside the if statement I hope you are understanding
people might not be aware what is the definition what is the difference between a flow decision
and an if so in case you're going to write
so in case you have two things say here you're having two boxes inside this two boxes
from here if I want to connect to the from here if I want to connect to the second step I won't
be able to connect from here if I want to connect to the second step inside this if I'll section
I want to be able to connect because if you see this is a sequence you won't be able to connect
automatically if you drag more activities a sequence will be created this is not just for
if it is going to be working in the same way for switch also okay so everywhere you create the
cases in the switch will be the similar to a sequence only so sequence is more linear so you
won't be able to perform multiple connecting to the previous box but in case you're going to use
a flow decision then you're going to have the same thing in case you're going to have a flow decision
on the false side you will still be able to go ahead and connect so this is the basic understanding
of where you need to use a flow decision and where you need to use a if statement if is going to be
used when you don't have when you have very simple operations so here after this if you want to
connect back to the first step then you're going to connect back it here okay this you won't be
able to allow to this you won't be able to or you're not allowed to do it in the if basic if
operation so your if is going to be the the either it is a then section R and L section is going to
be more linear okay but here in a flow decision you will have the same condition you can still go
ahead so precisely same thing will be working for your switch and a flow switch as well okay so you
have to precisely define whether you have options to reconnect elsewhere or you are making conditions
that you need to jump from one thing to another okay at that time you're going to have a flow decision
or a flow switch this is a basic difference between a flow decision and a flow switch between an
if and a switch the normal switch right so a flow decision and if is going to perform the same
set of operations two choices and if the choice is to if the choice is not so you way you make sure
the condition is met and accordingly your program will be branching across two things
similarly you have a switch and a flow switch so when you have multiple cases when you have
multiple choices okay if you have three choices you can stick to one flow decision with the
you know a flow decision a flow decision inside a flow decision so you can have another flow decision
here and then capture it so you can also do like that which is a nested if okay all all you can
prefer a flows switch or a switch which will have multiple information going across you know
different branches you have multiple options right and then we have the looping methodology
so the looping methodology is going to be used whenever you're going to have repetitive actions
so when you want to process the same data again or when you want to process or repetitively
perform same actions again so those type of scenarios you're going to have a looping methodology
if you are receiving mails 10 emails and you want to loop through all the 10 emails then you're
going to use the looping methodology if you're going to have a couple of file folders then you want to
say you're searching for a particular file inside it you want the file which is going to be with
this particular name only so what you'll do you'll go for the first thing see whether it has
that particular name second file see whether that it has a particular name third file yes the third
file has so probably searching for the file name one by one right so this is where we'll be using
the looping methodology where the same action is repeated multiple number of times so those
kind of scenarios where you're going to use the looping methodology so based on the kind of
action that you're going to perform whether you want to do it irrespectively for all the data
or for all the files or for all the information okay then you're going to use a forage okay whether
it is going to be data processing or a file processing or a mail processing if you're going to do
it for all the files for all the data for all the information then you're going to use a forage
which means it will scan the entire data together and it will do okay if it performs for the first
data it will perform for the last data also the same way right but if you want to perform
sorry but if you want to perform for a limited set of actions say a limited set of files so if you
want to perform only from the third file to the 10th file or the third data to the 10th data
then you are going to have a while or a do well okay so this condition you always need to remember
when you are supposed to introduce a while or a do well and when you are supposed to introduce
for each right so which means when you have for it is going to be for all data
if you want to scan through all data if you want to scan through all files every time you are
going to use for each so for each again you have two operations for each data table for each
control anything specific to data table data then you are going to have explicitly data table
for each row in data table okay so which means it will take the first row which will be the active
row then the third a second row which will be the active row so it will have only one row active
at a time when you use for each only one row will be active at a time okay then you are going to
have for each control so anything other than data table then you are going to have a for each
control so here you have to specify what kind of data you are processing so this is going to be
type argument is going to be available in the properties field where you go and say okay I am
processing file folders I am processing mail messages so when we were doing when we were doing
actually the the mail automation we were saying we are processing a for each control for
mail messages and we went and selected type argument system.net.mail.mail messages right so
that particular thing you have to give whenever you are good doing other than a data table you need
to because this is a generic for each control you need to say to UI path studio what exactly data
what kind of data you are going to process in the for each so that is why we have a type argument
so similarly the type argument is going to be available in the switch or type of data you are going
to pass through the switch what type of information you are going to pass through the switch right
so you have a for each control right and similarly you are going to have a while and a do while
while will be used for a specified part of your automation you are also a specified part of your
automation that you want to repeatedly process okay this is for all the data this is going to be
first specified information that you want to process the difference is going to be while
is going to have the condition first and then execute the iteration okay so if you say process
information between row count 1000 to 2000 to 2000 then it that will be the condition and only
that condition is satisfied it will go in loop through that particular information or do while
is going to be if you see process the information from 2001 to 2000 even whether the condition
or not it will process at least once because in the do while the body is going to be first and then
the condition will be in the while the condition will be first and then you want to have a body
when you can use a do while you can use a do while whenever you want to perform any kind of
operation whether the auto whether the condition is successful or not you want to perform it once
okay if you are searching for file folders whether the thing is there or not you might be going
and marking yes this particular is executing log file track the log file you might be say log I'm
executing this particular thing at least once time and you will be writing in a do a log this
particular execution happen so those particular scenarios you can go ahead and say do while loop
irrespective of whether the condition needs to be met or not you want to execute the condition
once you want to you want to execute the operation once at that time you go ahead and do do while
when you have a while you're just going to go and only if the condition is satisfied it will go
inside the iterating action otherwise it will not do an iteration at all this will do at least once
okay then we have something called a break a break is going to be can be used only inside the
forest activity similar to a do while when based on a condition you want to come out of the loop
then you can have a break statement and you can put it so you can also check it as
the first time you want to run and you want to put a break it will run the first time it will
do a break and it will come out so usually you can also define it as inside a forest you can
put it as when the data comes like this so you can put an if statement and in the do session
you can put a break and it will just come outside the thing okay so those type of scenarios you
will be you will be allowed usually a break is going to be inside the forest only so you put
a forest and a break it will just come out of that particular scenario come out of that particular
for loop okay so this is one the control flow routes then we actually went into excel automation
right the excel automation again is going to be very very important part of processing
when you are dealing with a lot of data processing so when you have data most of the projects that
might be coming will be manual intervention where they do a lot of data processing so you need to
convert it into an excel automation either you generate it in other port format or you get it in
the excel format and you want to do some data entries okay so those kind of all scenarios
you can do it appraisal process sales process any kind of reporting that you want to do or any kind
of you know data collection that you want to do all those things will be coming in the format of
excel okay so you have two options even a CSV data which is an unstructured format right so it is
not in the CSV format is a comma separated value format right it is not in terms of
for rows and columns even that format you will be able to convert it into a data table okay so how
you will do it is you can there is an option called generate data table even the unstructured data
will be converted into a generate data table which will be converted into a data table structured format
so you can also use it was CSV files okay so any unstructured data also you can go ahead and use
it into a data table any structured data that you have any bigger pieces of information then you
are going to have data table to some of the operations and you will be able to do it with the data
table you can create your own data table you can add values inside your own data table you can
add data columns you can add data rows okay you can club to data tables which is merge data table
you can take the data based on certain conditions between two data tables that is going to be
joining data tables okay so in case you want to just filter a particular data table you can use a
filtering method another important question in terms of interviews and in terms of certifications
what is the alternate method of using the filter wizard so without using the filter wizard how can
you actually filter on a particular column see suppose you have a column called employee ID
and some other value experience if you want to filter based on employee ID column and which is
equal to this particular value or 1001 if I want to filter based on that particular employee ID1
and the experience okay I should still be able to do it so how will I do it you have the select
option I will give you this syntax you have the select option okay so usually it will be the
data table dot select of the column name and the value and you put an and or an or condition
and then again you can put a column name and the value I will give you the syntax okay so this
is another alternate method okay so this particular alternate method also could be used whenever
you are whenever you are not using the filter method usually we go in for this particular thing
and we bring it from the configuration file okay so that the conditions will never be
even if the conditions need to be modified at any time you can go and modify it if in case you
need to fill get it from the configuration file otherwise you can just code it inside your program
and you can just put a select and the column names right so this is alternate method of a filter
wizard so you can similarly you can check between duplicate rows you can add or remove data columns
you can add or remove data rows okay so anywhere when you are processing excel we always process
row wise only so that is why we also do a row wise operation only with a far each row here okay
90% of the project we will be doing row wise operation only we won't be doing a column wise operation
right so those kind of scenarios only we achieve it through a far each row inside a data table
so you have a filter method you have a saw data table remove duplicate rows and join data table
so based on the data that is available between two or three tables you can
between two tables you can go ahead and join so you have an inner join outer join and a full join
so those particular actions will be done right then we have something called when we are doing
excel automation so we had two different varieties of excel right so excel activities are going to
be inside the package for dy path dot excel dot activities right so you have excel activities
which will be under app integration and next we have the system file workbook dot activities
so what are the differences I have defined it to you so one is going to be like
more specific when the application is available excel application is installed in your system
in your working system right and the other one is when excel is not installed so which means when
excel is installed you will be allowed to use the more you know complex operations inside excel
like doing graphical representations all those things you will be allowed to use when you are when
you are using workbook dot system dot workbook operations it will be the basic operations which
will be working based on the plugin that is already installed in your system you may not have an
excel but it might be talking in terms of Microsoft plugins that might be there okay so anywhere that
you do not have so when you are doing a basic operation on the excel like you are reading and then
you are doing simple operations like data table processing and then you want to update then go ahead
and use a workbook dot read range or workbook dot activities if you are doing complex operations
right then you can go ahead and write it inside the excel applications go so usually one other
differences if you write another difference between an excel operation is always you need to write
your code inside an excel application say suppose you are going to write it here okay always
you need to write if you are doing in your excel application scope if you are writing anything
whatever you are going to perform inside the excel which means a read range a for each data table
write range app and range filter data table whatever you are going to do needs to be inside only
inside the do block if you come outside of this and you write your piece of code will not work okay
this is you can take it as an advantage or you can take it as a disadvantage also okay so always
you need to write information so here also we have it as a sequence so you won't be able to connect
back to any any other previous information okay so that may be a drawback as certain scenarios
right for that only we just simply use a workbook dot read range and we simply go ahead
okay so that is why here when you see this particular read range the excel dot read range
will not have the the file information because you are writing always this inside the open file
only so that is why you don't have this read range or write range or app and range know where
you will have the file name it will just have the sheet name alone so you will be directly
since you need to write it only inside the do block assuming the page is already on the workbook
is already open that is why they have given according like this always you are supposed to use it
inside the excel application scope you cannot touch base and connect it to the previous blocks
or previous activities so that is you can take it as a drawback but most of the scenarios you might
not be involved in a condition like that okay so the other rearrange that you are going to do is
you are going to see the because you are not using the excel application scope it is a direct
workbook dot read range that is why you would be seeing the information of what is the workbook
name and then the sheet name okay so that is a major difference between using integration app
integration excel activities and a workbook system workbook dot activities okay so the basic
differences you need to put all your code inside the excel application scope only because you are
anything will not have the workbook name because you have already it is assumed that you have already
specified that to the excel application scope right so this is the information then there are
other differences also that you will be doing based on whatever you know whether it is a password
protected you can have the excel application scope the sheet might still be open for you it will not
throw an error here it will throw an error so all the differences I have already explained you can
verify the information that I have already explained right so back to our excel automation so what
actually happens what kind of data that you are going to have so anything that you are having as a
data that is inside the excel always needs to be converted into a data table and from the data
table only you are going to do all the processing why you need to do it from the data table it's going
to be more faster so the moment you do loaded into the data table and you're having it inside the
memory it's going to be more faster for you to do a lot of processing whether I mean when compared to
you connecting to the excel taking the values and then doing the processing there every time the
focus shift will be there from here it will be shifting to excel do some processing then again
it will shift to UI part studio there are too many focus shifts right so when these kind of operations
cause a memory leakage so for those reasons only we try to load the entire data table do all the
processing in the data table and then finally you do the updated data into an excel sheet so there
are two ways of update you can write the updated information if there's a requirement that you need
to take the data from the excel and updated back based on certain processing you can update the
data directly into an excel or if you have too much of data that you need to update then you update
into the data table and copy the entire data table into the excel sheet so override the excel sheet
with the updated data so it depends on your project requirement how you want to do so both the ways
there are advantages there are disadvantages however you have to wisely choose between what is your
data what is your kind of requirement this and accordingly you do your writing or you do your
processing okay the general method if you're just working on certain columns then you can do
direct excel update if you're working on multiple data and you want to do multiple updates and do a
data table full data table update so you're going to do a write range and you will or an up and
range and you will directly come in override the existing data okay so that particular information
you can do right so now coming back to your data right so you have couple of ways that you can
process your data so when you have when you know the information the location of your information
or sorry when you do not know the location of your information right so
you're going to scan the entire data which means search the entire data and then only you need to
identify right so those kinds of information you can go ahead and you can use a forage row which
means you need to scan through the data and fetch the values okay when you know the location of
the data you use the direct row index and the column index information so you can simply say
data table rows of row index and the column index it'll directly give you because why you cannot
use a row index and a column inside here because you just have one active row so in case in case
this has 10 rows the data table has 10 rows if you want to fetch the 9th row the first column
the data table structure itself will be of 10 rows so you can directly go and fetch it but inside
the forage row you only have the one single row so it is always row of 0 you cannot even the 9th row
will be appearing as the row of 0 only so you cannot use a row index and the column index
methodology here okay so it is not that you cannot use it is not the best practice it will still
allow you to use okay but it is not the best practice that you're supposed to use because you
already have the data table open and you already have one data table row only so you need not go
and specify the row index and the column index by default itself you have only 0 at the
row index and the column index only will be changing so that you can take it as the row of one
or row of the column name and you can go ahead so that is a difference right and one another thing
that is there is get row item okay maybe we might have not used it in the examples there is something
called a get row item so in your data table operations you have a get row item so for example
get row item is something that you can use it only inside a for each row okay so suppose you're
using a for each row and inside the for each row which means you have one active row okay say
suppose the first row is there so if you say get row item okay it will do the same information
as you're doing an design operation so what you need to give is you need to give the data table
row so if you have the row if you're if you're going to have the particular say if you want to take
the column that particular thing the employee name or the vendor tax ID is in the second column
you can give that particular column name and you are the index or the column name and you can go
ahead and get the fetched value this will instead of you using an assign and you will be putting
right as an STR first name is equal to row of you will be writing right row of name dot
two strength you might be writing it like this right so instead of this you can simply specify
the row of name so name will be the column name so you can simply go and specify the name
and you can create an output called STR first name automatically do that okay so it will
automatically get that particular item which is under the column called row of name so you can use
this also this is an alternate method okay if you don't want to create here also you create variable
here also you create variable however is a method you can go ahead and use that particular method
okay so get row item yeah then we saw examples of excel so we saw most of the 90% of your projects
will be coming in these kind of scenarios only where you are involved with doing data processing
so you know the location of the data and you don't know the location of the data so when you say
you just want to repeat the certain actions so irrespective of the location you want to repeat
the same set of actions for all the data then you are going to use a forage so what we did we
concatenated so the concatenation was something that we are repeating for all the data so we copied
this and this and then we concatenated we copy this copy this and concatenate copy this copy this
and concatenate right so here what we are doing a repetitive action is performed where this repetitive
action is performed as an iterative action so you keep this instead of writing it for 10 times
you are putting it inside a forage loop and you're just writing it as a looping operation so it
take this information take this information right at here take this take this right at here
so the iterative action is performed again and again for all the rows this was one set of data
where you are just performing iterative action or repetitive action for all the data the next kind
of data that we actually saw was a nested information where you have multiple shades and you're
going to compare the data here also you do not know where the data is so which means you're
you're taking this particular data and you're searching it here you're taking this this particular
data and you're searching it here right that was the example we saw so you do not know the exact
location of your data so those kind of scenarios again you're going to search or scan the data for all
data only you're going to do the searching right so at that time also you have to use a forage now
when you are talking about multiple workbooks or multiple work sheets then you're going to have
how many number of sheets you have that many number of forages you're going to talk okay again
here the catches you do not know the location of the data and you're going to scan across all the
data whether it is one sheet or multiple sheet if you have one sheet put out one forage if you
have multiple sheets put multiple forages so how your program will be working this will be your
base base sheet which will be the master sheet which you're going to compare so this will be one
forage so inside this you're going to compare here so inside this you're going to put a forage
for this and in case you're comparing it like from here to here also you're going to put a forage
three inside the forage one that is what we might have done so you did a sheet one forage a sheet
two forage and then the sheet one under sheet one only you're doing a sheet three forage so based
on what kind of operation suppose you're going to compare this with this and then this with this
then you're going to have forage then forage two which will be inside forage one and then
you're going to have forage three which will be inside forage two okay so based on whatever kind
of logic you are going to have that many forages you are going to have right so here you do not know
the location of the data and you're just going to scan across all the data and you're going to
search those kind of scenarios you're going to have a forage and when you want to write back to
the information you're going to have a right to right range or right cell basically then you're
going to if you're going to have right cell then you're going to have something called
excel counter so you will be defining the excel counter so if you want to write it in C2
then your end excel counter is equal is equal to two so you when you are finishing your forage
okay always before forage you write this increment okay so that you will not forget
so when you're writing it to say right cell in C2 right so you say right cell in C2 whatever is
your full name then what you're going to do before you finish it you're going to increment the
excel counter is equal to end excel counter plus one so from two it will change to three okay so like
this every time it will be incrementing and finally it will come out so the writing also will
happen in a in a incremented manner okay so if you're writing is not happening in an incremented
manner then you're going to go ahead and increment the excel counter just before the end of forage
so that it will work perfectly okay now this is when you have just one sheet your incrementing
is going to be fine okay but when you have multiple sheets okay I'm not in that okay so when you
have multiple sheets so when you have multiple sheets what is going to happen is your increment counter
will just be so how many times it will be comparing one will be compared with four two will be
compared with four three will be compared with four four will be compared with four so which means
you're incrementing it four into four so it is 16 times you're going to increment right but if
you see you're going to write back only in the four columns that you're having or four information
that you're having so always you increment it and again when you come out of the forage you are
going to change it back to the actual value so you will re-initialize the value so when you're
dealing with multiple worksheets and you're just having a limited set of data your row count will
be just incrementing as such when you're doing the comparison okay I'm not sure if you're remembering
so what will happen is this will be coming as row one with asha row two or in texel two then this
will be in texel three then in texel four now this will be asha with ramesh will be in texel five which
means it will be writing the data as c five that is not supposed to happen so then it'll be c six then
it'll be c seven then it'll be c eight no it is not that way that we are supposed to do so what
we'll do when it does the first time done it sir we are going to re-initialize back to two so what
we do we re-initialize it back to two and we are going to say when it comes to asha then again it will
start from c two c three c four c five upon again c two c three c four c five so whenever you're
handling with multiple excel sheets you have to re-initiate otherwise it will be writing at the
wrong indexes right so that that way you have to go ahead and write it in a different
term i mean in the same location so you can re-initialize so when you know when you do not know the
content of the data or the location of the data and you want to scan across all the data and you
want to iterate operations then you go ahead and use the for each look okay now when you know
the location of the data right so this was the second operation i said so you go ahead and say
sheet one so suppose sheet one you're comparing with sheet two then you go and write a for each
or sheet one a for each for sheet two this one you want to compare with sheet three then you put a
for each inside the sheet three sheet two okay so you put a for each inside the sheet two so this
is also based on whatever is your requirement you can go ahead and write now the third thing is
the method one where you know the location of the data whenever you want to compare a master data
sheet and a and a different data sheet so whenever you want to do sheet comparisons when you have a
mobile number updated or not address updated or not you might be checking right so based on the
checking on the comparisons you might be going and updating the information so those kind of scenarios
what we are going to do is we are going to go ahead and compare the same column number with a different
column okay maybe the content of the column will be different but the indexes might be the known
indexes which means you might be comparing 10 with 70 you might be comparing 20 with 55 you might
be comparing 10 with some other value here so which means this index also is known this index is also
known so those times you are going to use this simply directly the row index information so you
go ahead and say give the data table or rows of row index and the column number indexes so when
you use this you cannot use a forage right by default if you use this particular method
if you use this particular method then you cannot use a forage a forage can be used only
without this particular method so don't always remember this concept you cannot use this method
best practices you cannot use this method instead of forage so which means if you have this
particular operation then you have to trigger your own loop so when I have to trigger my own loop
I will be putting a while loop and say if it is a row count information if you want to say
I want to perform this particular operation between these rows only so you can give the row count
information if you want to say between row count is equal to 1000 and 2000 then that also you
can define it as a condition okay so when you know the content or the location of the data
and you are going to do it for a specific set of data so if you want to do it only for these
query information then you can say while loop mean row count between this and this you can

do the operations.
